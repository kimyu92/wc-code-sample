[{"Cedric SI MOHAMMED": "Cedric Si Mohamed began his career with Gueugnon in 2003/04, before embarking on short stays at a procession of amateur clubs over the next four years. In 2009, the French-born goalkeeper then packed his bags for the country of his parents, spending four seasons with Bejaia until he signed terms with Constantine at the start of the 2013/14 campaign. Renowned for his penalty-stopping skills, the 29-year-old first gained international recognition in 2009, when he was invited to an Algeria training camp ahead of qualifying games for the 2011 CAF African Nations Championship. He was handed his maiden cap the following year, in a friendly against Niger.  Si Mohamed's high-quality performances earned him inclusion in the squad for the 2011 African Nations Championship, where Algeria finished fourth. He was also selected for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, though he had to content himself with playing understudy to Rais M'Bolhi. Despite his fine displays in the Algerian league, Si Mohamed looks set to serve as third-choice custodian for \\xa0at Brazil 2014, with M'Bolhi boasting vital experience and Mohamed Lamine Zemamouche having played more of a role during the qualifying campaign. "}, {"Mohamed ZEMMAMOUCHE": "Algeria's second-choice goalkeeper, Mohamed Lamine Zamamouche contested just one qualifier ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, filling in for Rais M'Bolhi against Burkina Faso.\\xa0He made his international debut in 2010 and earned a squad place at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations the same year. During the finals, he played in the play-off for third place against Nigeria, having come on for the last few minutes of Algeria's last-four joust with Egypt following Faouzi Chaouchi's dismissal. Born in the Algerian town of Mila, Zamamouche started his professional career at USM Alger, helping the club win the Algerian title in 2003 and 2005 and finish runners-up in 2004 and 2006. He also lifted the Algerian Cup in 2003 and 2004, in addition to a pair of final losses. Zamamouche's spell with the capital side likewise yielded a run to the semi-finals of the 2003 CAF Champions League, where they were beaten by eventual winners Enyimba. Six years later, he signed for MC Alger, where he enjoyed another title triumph in 2010 before returning to his old club in 2011 and winning the 2013 UAFA Club Cup. "}, {"Rais MBOLHI": "Rais M'Bolhi has established himself as Algeria's first-choice goalkeeper in recent years, winning plaudits for his two games between the posts at the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 and playing a vital role on the road to Brazil 2014.\\xa0Born in France to a Congolese father and Algerian mother, M'Bolhi began his career at Marseille, where he made just one competitive appearance before his contract expired in 2006. From there, he took his talents to Heart of Midlothian in Scotland, only to experience further frustration on the sidelines. M'Bolhi was finally given a chance to prove himself in Greece for Ethnikos Piraeus, and just five games later he signed terms with Panetolikos. In 2008, he then packed his bags for Japan and a spell at Ryukyu, though he returned to Europe the following season to join Slavia Sofia.\\xa0After catching the eye at South Africa 2010, M'Bolhi took in a pair of loan stints with CSKA Sofia, either side of a short stay at Russian outfit Krylya Sovetov Samara. Subsequently loaned out to French club GFC Ajaccio, the custodian returned to CSKA Sofia on a permanent deal in summer 2013. M'Bolhi represented France at U-16 and U-17 level in his youth, but he opted to wear Algeria's colours after being called up by Rabah Saadane ahead of the 2010 World Cup. Three years later, he bolstered his major tournament experience at the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations. "}, {"Sergio ROMERO": "The ideal build for a goalkeeper, perhaps owing to the fact he comes from a family of basketball players, Sergio Romero has all the qualities required for his position, including sharp reflexes and a commanding presence in the air. Those attributes are just some of the reasons why Alejandro Sabella has kept faith with Romero despite his lack of first-team football at Monaco. \\xa0completed his apprenticeship in the youth ranks at Racing Club, where he made his first division debut in late 2006. Though few chances came his way with his club, that did not prevent him from excelling at the FIFA U-20 World Cup Canada 2007, where he conceded just two goals in helping Argentina take the title. His displays in Canada paved the way for a move to Dutch outfit AZ Alkmaar. After making the No1 spot his own there, he then won gold at the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament Beijing 2008, where he was called into the starting line-up by coach Sergio Batista to replace the injured Oscar Ustari. He won his first full cap for his country under Diego Maradona, who named him for a vital South Africa 2010 qualifying match against Paraguay in 2009. He has remained his country\u2019s first-choice custodian since then, playing in all five of Argentina\u2019s matches at the last world finals, all four at the 2011 Copa America and in 12 of their 14 qualifiers for Brazil 2014. During that time Romero went 27 games without experiencing defeat, a record for an Argentina goalkeeper. "}, {"Agustin ORION": "Unshowy and blessed with excellent positional sense, Agustin Orion is a goalkeeper with a strong character and a will to win. It is those qualities that helped him become the first-choice custodian at the three clubs he has played for and to win at least one title with each of them. Getting this far has been no easy task for Orion, who had to wait for four years at the start of his career before nailing down a regular first-team slot at San Lorenzo, the club where he learned his trade. His fine performances in 2007 earned a call-up from the then national team coach Alfio Basile for that year\u2019s Copa America in Venezuela, though he did not play. After winning the league with \\xa0, Orion signed for Alejandro Sabella\u2019s Estudiantes, where he collected another championship winner\u2019s medal. In the middle of 2011 he moved to Boca Juniors and enjoyed an exceptional debut season with the Buenos Aires giants, landing another league title and conceding only six goals in the process, a record for the short-tournament format in Argentina. In November that year Sabella handed him his international debut, giving him starts in back-to-back  against Brazil. Orion has been a regular presence in the  squad ever since, though he did not see any action in the qualifiers for Brazil 2014. "}, {"Mariano ANDUJAR": "Perfectly built for his position, Mariano Andujar boasts all the attributes an international goalkeeper needs: feline reflexes, fine positional sense and bags of character. A product of the youth academy at Huracan, the club closest to his heart and for whom he made his debut in 2003, Andujar tried his luck in Italian football with Palermo before returning home to win a league title with Estudiantes. It was at this stage that he got his first call for national duty, with Alfio Basile drafting him into the squad in November 2007 for two South Africa 2010 qualifying matches, though he saw no action in either of them. \\xa0Diego Maradona gave him his international debut in the same competition, against Colombia in 2009. Though he retained his place in the side for the next two games, he was replaced by Sergio Romero following the defeat to Brazil in Rosario, and remained an understudy at the World Cup the following year and at the 2011 Copa America. Current  coach Alejandro Sabella knows all about Andujar\u2019s gifts having been his coach at Estudiantes. Together they won the Copa Libertadores in 2009, with the keeper going 800 minutes without conceding a goal, a new record for the tournament. Though he has been part of the Argentina set-up since Sabella took over, Andujar, who is now with Catania, made only two appearances in the qualifiers for Brazil 2014, right at the start of the campaign. "}, {"Maty RYAN": "An unshowy but highly effective goalkeeper Ryan continues a\\xa0proud history of technically proficient Australian shotstoppers. Though only 22 Ryan is very much in the mix to fill the huge gap left by the surprise international retirement of Mark Schwarzer late last year.  After three successful seasons with Central Coast Mariners, the Sydneysider has greatly enhanced his international aspirations with a strong and highly consistent season at Club Brugge, with the Belgian club boasting a long tradition of Australian players dating back to Frank Farina in the late 1980s.  A dedicated professional with a strong character, Mat Ryan excelled in the A-League winning the competition\u2019s Young Player of the Year award in successive seasons, also claiming the goalkeeper of the year award once. He describes Schwarzer as a \u201cchildhood hero\u201d, and also hails the contribution of Mariners\u2019 goalkeeper coach John Crawley who spent several years of his own career in Chile, one of Australia\u2019s Group B opponents.  He debuted for Australia in late 2012, and significantly was handed the No1 jersey for the first two matches of Ange Postecoglou\u2019s reign, performing with distinction in each. "}, {"Mitch LANGERAK": "Another that started his international career at youth level after being plucked from obscurity by Ange Postecoglou during his tenure as U-20 coach. Langerak is a highly accomplished shot-stopper capable of making spectacular saves. Tall and lean in build he is a dedicated and enthusiastic trainer, committed to improving himself.  Now 25, Langerak has now spent four years as No2 behind Roman Weidenfeller at German Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund. Nevertheless he is highly rated by Borussia coach Jurgen Klopp and has stepped into the first team on several high-profile occasions, performing with distinction. Many of his Borussia appearances have been in demanding environments. He notably made a winning Bundesliga debut in the 2010/11 season at the home of rivals Bayern Munich, coming\\xa0on as a first-half substitute as Borussia defeated the same opponent in the 2012 German Cup final.  Raised in the rural Queensland town of Bundaberg, Langerak received his first senior national team call-up for the international against, ironically enough, Germany in 2011. His debut, however, saw Australia thrashed 6-0 by France last October in Paris, in what was Holger Osieck\u2019s final match in charge. "}, {"Eugen GALEKOVIC": "One of Australian football's quiet achievers, Eugene Galekovic has been outstanding for Adelaide United since joining the club in 2006. Indeed, he has claimed the A-League goalkeeper of the year crown in four of the past eight seasons since moving from his hometown of Melbourne.  Though not possessing an obvious physical presence, Galekovic is a reliable high-quality shot-stopper and his numerous seemingly impossible saves would make for a stunning career highlights reel. Galekovic\u2019s form helped Adelaide to several successful runs in the AFC Champions League, including an unlikely run to the 2008 final, easily the best performance by an Australian club to date.\\r\\n He was Australia\u2019s third choice goalkeeper at South Africa 2010 having earned a late call-up following Brad Jones\u2019 eleventh-hour withdrawal for personal reasons. Though left on the bench in South Africa, Galekovic did feature in all four matches for Australia at the 2004 Olympic Football Tournament in Athens.  Galekovic debuted for the Socceroos in early 2009 in an AFC Asian Cup qualifier and has been a semi-regular squad member ever since.  "}, {"Thibaut COURTOIS": "Success has tended to come naturally to Thibaut Courtois. Just 17 when he made his top-flight debut with Genk, it quickly became clear he possesses all the tools that make up the perfect goalkeeper: good positioning, electric reflexes on his line, an impressive leap and total mastery of his box. On top of that, the 6\\'6\" custodian can lay claim to almost unparalleled mental strength. \"I\\'ve had to look hard to find any sort of flaw in his character \u2013 and I still can\\'t find one,\" said Roland Breugelmans, head of Genk\\'s youth academy.\\r\\nMaking the goalkeeper\\'s jersey his own, Courtois played an integral part as Genk won only the third Belgian title in their history in 2011, and he himself was voted best No1 in the division. Having conquered Belgium, Courtois then looked further afield to continue his development, with Chelsea luring him to Stamford Bridge. The Premier League giants immediately loaned him out to Atletico Madrid, and Courtois helped  lift the UEFA Europa League in 2012, while emerging as one of the keenest new talents on the Spanish scene. No goalkeeper conceded fewer goals in 2012/13, and Courtois\\'s heroics also helped his side claim the Copa del Rey. This season he followed up those achievements with a La Liga winners medal and a runners-up medal in the UEFA Champions League.\\r\\nSuch performances were regarded with glee and expectation back in his homeland, and the player nicknamed Tarantula showed all his trademark composure as he made his international bow in a goalless draw with France in November 2011. He went on to contest every minute on the road to Brazil 2014, shipping just four goals, leaving no doubt that  (Red Devils) possess a thoroughbred for many years to come. "}, {"Simon MIGNOLET": "Currently Belgium\u2019s second-choice goalkeeper behind Thibaut Courtois in the eyes of national coach Marc Wilmots, Simon Mignolet is a useful back-up option should the need arise. A native of Saint-Truiden, the commanding custodian made his professional debut for his home-town team in 2005 at the age of 17. Five fruitful years later, with the Belgian Goalkeeper of the Year award tucked under his belt, he crossed the English Channel to try his luck at Sunderland.\\r\\nThe three seasons that he spent in the north-east of England only served to confirm his shot-stopping skills, which had already seen him represent Belgium in various youth categories. On 25 March 2011, he was handed his first senior cap against Austria, keeping a clean sheet in a 2-0 victory. In 2013, the athletic Belgian took his career onto a new level by signing for Liverpool. Mignolet, who speaks five languages and holds a degree in political science, finished off the calendar year with 141 saves to his name, more than any other Premier League keeper. "}, {"Sammy BOSSUT": "Sammy Bossut had been expecting to watch Brazil 2014 back home on television only for injuries to Belgium\u2019s original third-choice keeper Koen Casteels and his replacement Silvio Proto to open his way to the world finals. Only too happy to cancel his holidays, the Zulte Waregem No1 is about to fulfil a childhood dream in Brazil, where he will form part of a golden Belgian generation. \u201c  are a truly fantastic team both on and off the pitch,\u201d he said. \\r\\nBossut has come a long way since the start of his career, when he earned a reputation as a keeper capable of the best and the worst, owing to the odd rush of blood to the head. Committed and determined, Bossut has become a vital cog at Zulte, the club he has played for since 2008, earning a reputation as a very safe pair of hands in a side that has now broken into the Belgian elite, reward for which has come in the shape of an unexpected trip to Brazil. "}, {"Asmir BEGOVIC": "Asmir Begovic has rocketed from the English lower-leagues into one of the most coveted goalkeepers in Europe in recent years. The admiring glances Real Madrid, Manchester City and Manchester United have paid the Bosnia-Herzegovina No1, and his authorative performances in 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifying, are testament to that.  Begovic\u2019s family \u2013 his father was an ex-keeper \u2013 fled war-torn Bosnia when he was an infant. He was brought up in Germany and Canada, whom he represented at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2007.  Begovic had joined Portsmouth three years earlier but, after multiple flitting loan spells, finally made his Premier League debut for Pompey in 2009. The following year, aged 21, he signed Stoke for \u00a33.25m and, after unseating Thomas Sorensen during 2010/11, began the next season as the Potters\u2019 first-choice between the sticks.  It proved a breakout campaign for Begovic, who finished it as Stoke\u2019s player of the year and as the first defensive player to win Bosnia\u2019s annual Idol of the Nation award. The 6ft 6ins keeper\u2019s fine form continued in 2013/14, catching the eye with some superb saves and a goal, from 97.5 yards, after just 13 seconds against Southampton.  \"I firmly believe Asmir has proven over the last few years that he\\'s the best goalkeeper in the Premier League,\u201d said Stoke chairman Peter Coates as some of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs circled.  Begovic had yet to made his senior bow for Canada, despite being included in a couple of squads, when he agreed to switch allegiances to Bosnia-Herzegovina. The man who grew up idolizing Oliver Kahn debuted for his birth nation in late-2009, quickly established himself as their first-choice, and produced wonderful displays in the Brazil 2014 preliminaries, particularly in a 0-0 draw in Greece and a 2-1 win in Slovakia. "}, {"Jasmin FEJZIC": "While it\u2019s unclear who Bosnia\u2019s second-choice goalkeeper is, due to the fact Asmir Begovic was an ever-present during 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifying, Jasmin Fejzic replacing Asmir Avdukic as the No12 during that campaign may give an indication.  Fejzic uses his 6ft 6in frame to command his area. He also possesses sharp reflexes for someone of his size.  After a few years of largely warming benches at Stuttgarter Kickers and Greuther Furth, Fejzic got his breakthrough during a two-year loan spell at Eintracht Braunschweig from 2007. He saw little action upon his return to Greuther, but after coming on as a substitute in a DFB-Pokal semi-final against Borussia Dortmund, Ilkay Gundogan's shot with six seconds remaining cannoned back off the post on to Fejzic\u2019s head and went into the net.\\r\\nHe transferred to VfR Aalen in 2012 and, after confining Daniel Bernhardt to the bench, impressed during the 2013/14 German second flight. "}, {"Asmir AVDUKIC": "Asmir Avdukic is a goalkeeper who boasts ten years of international experience but, contradictably, just a few caps. The reason for this is the presence of Asmir Begovic, Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2019s undisputed first-choice between the sticks, but coach Safet Susic has described the deputy as someone he \u201cwouldn\u2019t hesitate to call upon\u201d.  Avdukic, born in the former Yugoslavia in 1981, began his career with Celik Zenica \u2013 the first of six clubs from six Bosnian cities he would defend. Avdukic also played for Kamen Ingrad in the Croatian top tier and on loan at Iranian giants Persepolis. The 6ft 3ins keeper helped the latter reach the last 16 in the AFC Champions League 2012, performing superbly in a 3-0 win over Al-Gharafa in Doha.  Avdukic\u2019s best season in his homeland came when he captained Borac Banja Luka to Bosnian Premier League glory in 2011, keeping an incredible 19 clean sheets in 30 games along the way. He also helped them finish third in 2012/13.

Finding his opportunities at  limited after turning professional, he was loaned out to Botafogo in 2003. Two years later he was transferred to Trabzonspor of Turkey, where he remained until 2008, while the goalkeeper also had a short spell at fellow Turkish team Konyaspor in 2008/09. And it was not until 2009, after arriving back in his homeland with Botafogo, in Rio de Janeiro, that the keeper really began to carve out a reputation in the minds of Brazilian fans. The following season he saved a crucial penalty taken by Adriano to seal the Rio de Janeiro state championship for  He also helped Botafogo lift the same trophy in 2013.\\xa0 Playing for , Jefferson was part of the squad that won the FIFA U-20 World Cup United Arab Emirates 2003. As a senior player, he was called up for the first time by coach Mano Menezes in 2010 for a friendly against USA. He was also a member of the squad for the 2011 Copa America, his first official tournament. Jefferson was a sub during the FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil 2013 and his main rivals for the No1 jersey at Brazil 2014 will be the experienced Julio Cesar, who currently plies his trade at Toronto FC, and Victor of Atletico Mineiro. "}, {"JULIO CESAR": "Born in Rio de Janeiro in 1979, Julio Cesar made his professional debut with Flamengo in 1997 and stayed with the club for seven years, winning four Rio state titles in that time and becoming a firm favourite with the  faithful. In 2005, it was time for a change of scenery. The goalkeeper signed for Inter Milan, only to be loaned out to Chievo Verona, for whom he never played a game. On his return to the San Siro, he dislodged the highly regarded Francesco Toldo from the No1 slot and established himself as one of the world\u2019s finest custodians. \\xa0 \\r\\nHis first international call-up came at the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, where he was understudy to Dida. The following year he played an instrumental role in Brazil\u2019s Copa America triumph, saving a penalty in the final against Argentina. A reserve keeper at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany\u2122, he was first-choice for his country four years later in South Africa. Dropping out of the side after the 2011 Copa America, Julio Cesar returned to the fold in 2013, when Luiz Felipe Scolari recalled him after taking charge of the national team, regardless of his status in club football.  At the end of the 2011/12 campaign, the veteran GK left Inter for Queens Park Rangers. He had some ups and downs with the English club and, after a long period of inactivity, he moved to Major League Soccer side Toronto FC. \\r\\n"}, {"VICTOR": "If it is true that every coach needs a goalkeeper he can rely on, then Victor should be feeling pretty good about himself these days. Brazil have had three managers (Dunga, Mano Menezes and now Luiz Felipe Scolari) since winning the FIFA Confederations Cup 2009, and all three have called on the Atletico Mineiro stopper. Yet Victor missed out on the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122, despite having been selected for Brazil\u2019s Confederations Cup squad a year earlier. \u201cOf course I was disappointed, but it also made me try even harder,\u201d he told\\xa0. Mano Menezes, who had been his coach at Gremio, selected him for his first squad after that World Cup, but Menezes was fired in 2012, and in the same year Victor was surprisingly transferred to Atletico Mineiro. Such changes seemed to cause his international stock to fall. He did not allow his head to drop, however, and was one of the heroes of Atletico\u2019s victorious Copa Libertadores campaign last year, when he caught the eye of current Brazil manager Scolari. \u201cIn football you have to be consistent for both your club and the national team. You need to play well for one to guarantee your place in the other,\u201d he said. It is curious how things change: after missing out on last year\u2019s Confederations Cup, Victor can now call himself a World Cup goalkeeper. "}, {"Claudio BRAVO": "Not many goalkeepers can say that they have a street named after them, though that is exactly the honour bestowed on Claudio Bravo by his hometown of Buin, close to the Chilean capital of Santiago. The Chile captain is one of the stars of Jorge Sampaoli\u2019s side, a keeper who possesses sharp reflexes, astute positional sense, a cool head and a gift for leadership. Sound in the air and on the deck, Bravo inherited the skipper\u2019s armband from the great Marcelo Salas in 2008, having been elected to the post, just as his predecessor was, by his team-mates.  After failing to make much of an impression as a forward and then a defender, Bravo decided to try his luck between the posts. He joined Colo Colo at the age of 11 and eventually triumphed there after almost giving up the game due to a lack of stature. No sooner had he won the 2006 Apertura with  than he joined Real Sociedad, where he has also become an idol and has racked up the second-highest number of appearances by a foreigner at the club. After helping the San Sebastian side win the Spanish second division title in 2010, Bravo then played his part as they reached the UEFA Champions League for the first time in 2013. Though the custodian enjoyed little luck at the South American U-20 Championships in Uruguay in 2003, he made his full international debut under Nelson Acosta only a year and a half later at the Copa America in Peru. By the end of the qualifiers for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany\u2122, he had become  first-choice keeper.  Nicknamed (Little Monkey) in recognition of his agility, Bravo retained the gloves for the successful South Africa 2010 qualifying campaign and with 78 caps to his name, he has former striker Leonel Sanchez\u2019s record of 85 appearances for Chile in his sights, a record he could pass at the world finals. "}, {"Cristopher TOSELLI": "Cristopher Toselli rose to prominence in 2007 thanks to his dazzling displays at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada, where the finest crop of players in Chile\u2019s history won the bronze medal. Toselli, who would later become known as \u2018Hulk\u2019, set a new tournament record for that age category after going 492 minutes without conceding. The goalkeeper has spent his entire career at Universidad Catolica since joining the club as a 12-year-old. Despite his success with the U-20s, the custodian\u2019s agility, exceptional reflexes and awareness were not enough to cement a place in the first team. It was not until 2011 that Toselli was truly able to make the No1 jersey his own. He was part of the squad that won the Chilean league title in 2010 and the domestic cup in 2011. \\r\\nToselli has been a feature of the national set-up since he was 15, participating at the South American U-17 Championship Venezuela 2005 and the continent\u2019s U-20 competition in Paraguay prior to his breakthrough in Canada.

The goalkeeper was urged to take up football by his older brother Thierno, who played in France for Olympique Marseille and internationally for Guinea.  The younger Barry went for trials with Stella Abidjan, but failed to make the grade as a midfielder. He then urged the coaches at the ASEC Mimosas academy to give him a try and it was there that his qualities as a keeper were recognized. He signed his first professional contract with Mimosas in 1999, and went to French club Stade Rennes a year later after the French club noticed him during a youth tour.  At Rennes he failed to usurp international goalkeepers Bernard Lama and Petr Cech and he joined Beveren in 2003, first on loan and then on a permanent move. He stayed with the club until 2007, before moving to Lokeren, where he has since been\\xa0their first choice goalkeeper. He has twice won the Belgian Cup with Lokeren and has been voted as the best goalkeeper in the country. The 34-year-old first played for the Elephants in 2000 and, since establishing himself as the first choice goalkeeper, has been virtual ever-present. His international highlight came at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations, where he did not concede a goal in open play at the 2012 edition as C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire lost on penalties in the final against Zambia.  After playing once in the preliminaries for the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122 finals, Barry has missed just one qualifier since then. Widely recognised as one of Africa's best goalkeepers, he has experience even at the highest level, playing once at Germany 2006 and in all three games for his side four years later.

Although the club failed to qualify for the semi-finals, the 25-year-old did enough to firmly establish himself as one of his nation's goalkeepers. He moved to the San Pedro-based side in 2009 and three years later established himself as No1, earning the respect of the club's loyal fans with a string of impressive performances across competitions. Gbohouo is a commanding goalkeeper, who is particularly strong when coming off his line to pluck high balls from the air. After failing to make the Elephants' 2013 Africa Cup of Nations squad when coach Sabri Lamouchi gave Daniel Yeboah and Badra Ali Sangare the nod as reserve goalkeepers behind Boubacar Barry, Gbohouo found his way into the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire squads for the country's six final FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying matches, including the play-off games against Senegal.

Although it seems unlikely that he will get much playing-time at the finals, Mande will gain some valuable experience and could well use his time in Brazil with the Elephants to stake his place to be in contention to take over from Boubacar Barry. He already stood in for the Ivorian goalkeeping legend in the 2-2 draw against Belgium in March. Stabaek is extremely proud of Mande\\'s call-up for the Elephants, with goalkeeper coach Espen Granli saying that it is the first time a player from the club has made it to the World Cup. \"This is great for the club. Mande has worked extremely hard, determined and has performed consistently at a high level this season. His call-up is very deserving.\""}, {"Loic FEUDJOU": "Loic Feudjou was first called up to the Indomitable Lions in early 2012, when he had played little more than a handful of games in his country\\'s top flight. At that stage he had already tasted international football as he made Cameroon\\'s Olympic squad when he was still on the books of third division club Botafogo in 2011. He then joined Coton Sport and has been with the flagship of Cameroonian football since then, winning the league in 2013. Last year he played an important role as Coton Sport reached the semi-finals of the CAF Champions League. Since first being called up for national duty, Feudjou, who is considered a great shot stopper with super reflexes, has been a regular in the squad. He was called up for several 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifiers, but he has failed to get past first Idriss Kameni and now Charles Itandje. Coton Sport coach Didier Gomez Da Rosa said Feudjou deserves to have been called up. \"He is simply the best goalkeeper in the national championship, the only one of international stature. He has the potential to be successful. I am convinced he has all the skills required to play in Europe,\" said the coach, who himself was a goalkeeper. Earlier this year Feudjou was watched by scouts of English club Reading and it could well be that he makes a move to Europe after the finals in Brazil."}, {"Charles ITANDJE": "Born in France, Charles Itandje has taken over the role of Cameroon's first-choice\\xa0goalkeeper from Carlos Kameni. Itandje played at youth level for France, and he was included in the extended list of players for before the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany\u2122. He never got to play for the French, though, and thereafter declared his interest to play for Cameroon. He was cleared to play for the Indomitable Lions in 2010 and the 31-year-old featured prominently for the west Africans as they secured a second-consecutive appearance on football's greatest stage, taking over the number one position after the country's first two qualifiers and then keeping it for the remaining six matches. Itandje first played for Paris-based Red Star before making his name at Lens, where he enjoyed seven successful seasons, playing in well over 150 matches for the club. He moved to Premier League side Liverpool in August 2007 as understudy to Pepe Reina and played a few cup games for the Reds, but his career with the club never really took off. He went on loan to Greek club Kavala before being released from his contract with Liverpool to join Atromitos. Last year he was transferred to Greek giants PAOK and was loaned to Turkish Super Lig club Konyasport, for whom he performed well. "}, {"Sammy NDJOCK": "Sammy N'Djock is one of a growing number of African players plying their trade in Turkey. After coming through the youth ranks at French club Lille, whom he joined as a teenager, the goalkeeper was hoping to break through into the senior side. When that did not happen, he moved to Turkish club Antalyaspor in 2010. He was loaned out to newly promoted Fethiyespor at the beginning of the 2013/14 season and received regular playing time with the club based in Fethiye. The 24-year-old was in goal when the club, playing in its first-ever season in the top flight, recorded arguably their best-ever result, knocking Turkish giants Fenerbahce out of the cup with a 2-1 victory in Istanbul. N'Djock, whose main strengths in goal are his rapid reflexes and strong positional sense, was called up regularly as the Indomitable Lions secured a second consecutive appearance at the FIFA World Cup\u2122, but he failed to get on the pitch. It would come as a major surprise if he gets off the bench in Brazil, but with time on his side and experienced still to be gained, he could well become his country's number one goalkeeper in the future. "}, {"David OSPINA": "Regardless of the attacking firepower in the Colombia team, one of their biggest stars is undisputedly the No1 David Ospina. The only Colombian not to miss a single minute of qualifying ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, he is considered indispensable by coach Jose Pekerman.\\xa0  Ospina is a mature, highly-competent goalkeeper who stands out for his ability to marshal the rearguard. It is no coincidence that his country ended the South-American preliminaries with the best defensive record, conceding only 13 times in 16 games.\\xa0  He received his footballing education at the academy of former pro Alexis Garcia and first played between the sticks by chance. The then-striker only tried his hand at goalkeeping when filling in for his youth team\u2019s regular keeper. From there he joined the Atletico Nacional youth set-up and would become the youngest ever league champion in Colombian football history at 18. It came as little surprise, therefore, to see him seize the chance to play in Europe, where he has been first-choice custodian with Nice since 2008.\\xa0  A regular on the international scene since his days as a youth player, Ospina was part of the  squad which competed at the FIFA U-20 World Cup 2005 at just 17, although he did not feature. His debut with the senior side would arrive just one year later against Uruguay due to the sending-off of the late Miguel Calero. After that, he became a squad regular before eventually making the No1 jersey his own in 2009 and featuring in six qualifying matches ahead of South Africa 2010.\\xa0  Given Colombia\u2019s failure to qualify for South Africa and an inopportune injury that ruled him out of the Copa America 2011, Brazil 2014 will be the 25-year-old\u2019s first major tournament at senior level. "}, {"Camilo VARGAS": "Though goalkeeping is his trade, one of Camilo Vargas\u2019 most memorable performances came when he scored the winning goal for Santa Fe in a 2011 instalment of their rivalry with Millonarios, the oldest derby in Colombian football. Aside from his goalscoring abilities, the 25-year-old custodian possesses lightning reflexes, is as agile as they come and is something of an expert at saving penalties. \\r\\nVargas\u2019 brothers tried their luck as keepers but were unable to break into professional football. After starting out with Maracaneiros, he showed them how it was done, moving to Bogota side Santa Fe at the age of 16 and making his first division debut there in 2007. An idol at the club, he went on to win a Colombian league, Cup and Super Cup with them.\\r\\nA youth international with Colombia, Vargas has still to make his full international debut, though he has been an ever-present in Jose Pekerman squads since September 2012 and a lucky charm to boot \u2013 in the 11 Brazil 2014 World Cup qualifiers  played after the keeper\u2019s first call-up they lost just one. \\r\\nAlthough Vargas goes to Brazil 2014 as Pekerman\u2019s third-choice behind David Ospina and the veteran Faryd Mondragon, the world finals will represent a valuable experience for a keeper whose stock is rising all the time and who has a big future ahead of him. "}, {"Faryd MONDRAGON": "Faryd Mondragon was Colombia\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper during the 1998 FIFA World Cup France\u2122, their most recent appearance on the global stage. The 42-year-old has the distinction of being only the second Colombian after Carlos Valderrama to have taken part in five different World Cup qualifying campaigns, albeit as a non playing member for three of those.\\xa0  Mondragon first experienced FIFA\u2019s flagship tournament as understudy to Oscar Cordoba at USA 1994 and has been part of the squad for each subsequent qualifying campaign except that of South Africa 2010. And while he did not accrue any playing time on the road to Brazil, his imposing physique and personality mean he continues to be as commanding in the box as ever.\\xa0  Mondragon brings vast experience to the current  squad, something coach Jose Pekerman values highly, not least because (The Turk) is the only squad member to have previously competed at a World Cup.\\xa0  The keeper\u2019s 24-year professional career has taken him to various corners of the globe, with spells at Independiente in Argentina, Galatasaray in Turkey and FC Koln in Germany, among others. If there is one team that defines him, however, it is Deportivo Cali \u2013 the club where he made his debut at 19 and where he is again a key player today.  For the evergreen shot-stopper, a third World Cup would be a fitting end to a long and successful career. "}, {"Keylor NAVAS": "With more than 50 caps to his name, Keylor Navas has asserted himself as Costa Rica\u2019s\\xa0first-choice goalkeeper\\xa0since 2008. In 2005, Costa Rican heavyweights Saprissa signed the youngster to his first professional contract. It took Navas a few seasons to break into the first team, but from 2008 to 2010 he earned the starting role for Saprissa and was influential in his side\u2019s triumphant 2008/09 Apertura season. During his time at Saprissa, Navas earned his first cap with  in 2008, and he was named the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup\u2019s best goalkeeper as Costa Rica reached the semi-finals, who were only beaten on penalties by Mexico. Shortly thereafter, then-Spanish second division side Albacete snatched Navas up in 2010.\\xa0Levante came calling a year later and after a spell on loan with the La Liga side, Navas\u2019 move was made permanent. After serving as Gustavo Munua\u2019s backup for two seasons, Navas is now Levante\u2019s top choice in net. With a starting role secured at the club level and a successful FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying campaign under his belt, Keylor Navas looks poised to offer his safe hands to Jorge Luis Pinto\u2019s side in Brazil. "}, {"Patrick PEMBERTON": "In the national team picture since 2010, Patrick Pemberton has not been able to establish himself as a consistent presence in goal for\\xa0Costa Rica, but nevertheless he has served admirably for  on many occasions. En route to Costa Rica\u2019s successful qualification, Pemberton filled in for Keylor Navas during two CONCACAF \u2018Hexagonal\u2019 matches, earning two vital draws for Costa Rica along the way. Pemberton put together a spectacular season between the posts for Alajuelense in 2013, which undoubtedly caught the eye of Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto, and he has seen continued success with Alajuelense\u2019s progression in the CONCACAF Champions League. In addition to his two Hexagonal appearances, Pemberton also filled in for Costa Rica\u2019s quarter-final 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup run, surrendering only two goals in four matches. Additionally, Pemberton was named the best goalkeeper at the 2013 UNCAF Copa Centroamericana that saw Costa Rica claim the regional championship for a record seventh time. While Navas looks prepared to take the starting role for  at Brazil 2014, Pinto will be comforted knowing there is no lack of depth or experience in his side\u2019s last line of defence. "}, {"Daniel CAMBRONERO": "Inexperienced at\\xa0international level, Daniel Cambronero is expected to be Jorge Luis Pinto\u2019s third-choice goalkeeper at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122. Cambronero made his way through the youth ranks at Saprissa before making his professional debut with Puntarenas in 2007. The 28-year-old then had a two-year stint at Universidad de Costa Rica before making a move to Herediano in 2011 where he is currently enjoying a fine run of form, helping the club secure second place finish in the 2013 Primera Division Apertura season behind Saprissa. A veteran of the FIFA U-17 World Cup Finland 2003, where he helped lead  to an impressive quarter-final finish, Cambronero has been given only a handful of caps for Costa Rica\u2019s senior national team and has been largely out of the  set-up since 2011. Cambronero has been a part of several national team camps, however, and he was part of the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup squad, though he did not see the field during the competition. With Keylor Navas in outstanding form for both club and country of late, Cambronero will likely go unused at Brazil 2014 but the experience he can gain under the tutelage of both Navas and back-up goalkeeper Patrick Pemberton will be invaluable as he continues to fine-tune his trade at Herediano. "}, {"Stipe PLETIKOSA": "Goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa has been a regular part of the Croatian national team for 15 years and his consistency lends stability to the  defence. The 35-year-old has more than 100 caps to his name, including appearances at UEFA EURO 2008 and 2012 as well as the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups\u2122, and has appeared for the national side at every level from U-15 upwards. Croatia\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper at Korea/Japan 2002 at the age of 23, he remains in the role to this day. Pletikosa celebrated a special milestone on 6 February 2013, when he won his 100th\\xa0cap together with team-mates Darijo Srna and Josip Simunic in an international match against Korea Republic. The 2002 Croatian Player of the Year spent his youth and the early part of his senior career at Hajduk Split before moving to Shakhtar Donetsk and later to Spartak Moscow. Pletikosa has amassed six titles in his homeland and Ukraine in a career spanning almost 20 years. The \u201cOctopus\u201d, as he is affectionately known by many fans, has also suffered several setbacks over the years. He suffered a serious muscle injury shortly before UEFA EURO 2004, resigning him to the role of a spectator at Europe\u2019s biggest tournament. At club level, he also endured a disappointing loan spell at Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur during the 2010/11 season, managing just one appearance for Spurs before moving to top-flight Russian club FK Rostov the following season. Apart from Mario Mandzukic, Pletikosa was the only Croatian player to feature in all 12 of his team\u2019s qualifying matches (including play-offs) for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Thanks to his exceptional physical fitness, though he will be Croatia\u2019s oldest player at this summer\u2019s competition, it is highly unlikely to be the 35-year-old's final appearance at a major international tournament. "}, {"Oliver ZELENIKA": "Oliver Zelenika making an appearance in Brazil would be one of the biggest surprises of this summer. The 21-year-old will travel as the third-choice goalkeeper for Croatia, having not yet tasted senior international football. Regular keeper Stipe Pletikosa, aged 35, is coach Niko Kovac\u2019s undisputed No1, while 29-year-old Danijel Subasic will act as his back-up. Nevertheless, Zelenika, a surprise inclusion ahead of Lovre Kalinic, previously a regular in recent squads, has plenty of time to impress. Zelenika\u2019s development in the last 12 months has undoubtedly helped the rangy custodian to emerge as a viable candidate for a place in the  squad. He made his U-21 debut a year ago under none other than Kovac, who was evidently impressed enough to gamble on the youngster for the upcoming 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122. He joined Dinamo Zagreb at the age of 13 and signed his first professional contract with the club from Croatia\u2019s capital in 2011, spending 2012/13 out on loan at Rudes and part of 2013/14 loaned to Lokomotiva Zagreb. He has represented his country at every youth level and made three appearances in the FIFA U-20 World Cup Turkey 2013. "}, {"Danijel SUBASIC": "Danijel Subasic\u2019s rise has been over the past two years nothing short of exceptional. Since leaving Hajduk Split in the winter of 2011/12 for then second-division French outfit AS Monaco, the goalkeeper quickly became first-choice No1. On the final day of the same season, Subasic even scored from a free-kick, his only ever goal in a competitive match. After promotion to Ligue 1 in 2013, the club invested over \u20ac100m, bringing in world-class players such as Radamel Falcao, Joao Moutinho and James Rodriguez. Monaco were suddenly competing for the title, but Subasic had no problem adapting to the increased expectation levels and fitted right in among his illustrious new colleagues. In the national team he has rarely been afforded an opportunity to shine, though that has more to do with the experience of first-choice custodian Stipe Pletikosa who, with over 100 caps has become something of an institution between the sticks for Croatia, than his own performances. Subasic made his debut in November 2009 and was part of the squad which travelled to UEFA EURO 2012.

The Guayaquil-born shot-stopper made his first-team breakthrough at a very young age, back when Espoli were languishing in the Ecuadorian second division. His form was instrumental in earning promotion in 2005, but relegation soon followed and his calming influence at the back again helped the club bounce back up to the top flight in 2008. Banguera was in goal for what was arguably Ecuador's greatest ever achievement in international football, when an U-17 side took gold at the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro. He received his first senior cap against Haiti in 2008 and was an unused member of the squad in qualifying for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa and at the 2011 Copa America. Nicknamed  (The Yellow Padlock), in 2009 Banguera signed for hometown club Barcelona, where he nailed down the No1 spot with some outstanding displays and won the title in 2012.

His assured displays earned him a switch to Deportivo Quito, where he clinched the title in 2011, and he currently plies his trade for another big Quito club, El Nacional. Bone made his senior Ecuador debut in a friendly against Jamaica back in September 2011.

The only Monaco player to emerge with credit when the club were relegated in 2010/11, he subsequently switched to Saint-Etienne, helping them impress in the upper reaches of Ligue 1 and earning himself a spot in France's 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 travelling party. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 "}, {"Mickael LANDREAU": "Having spent the entirety of his career in France, goalkeeper Mickael Landreau set the all-time record for Ligue 1 appearances on 4 December last year. Throughout his years in the game, he has won admiration for his spectacular saves and rapid reflexes, and he has also foiled many a forward from the penalty spot. His talent was evident at a young age, and Landreau made his top-flight debut for Nantes at 17, before tying down a first-team place and being awarded the captain's armband. He also played a central role as  lifted a pair of French Cups in 1999 and 2000 and clinched the league title in 2001.\\r\\nLandreau enjoyed his first international call-ups during his time at Nantes, but with Fabien Barthez and Gregory Coupet ahead of him in the queue, his opportunities were limited. He thus travelled to UEFA EURO 2004 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122 as France's third-choice custodian, and after the latter tournament he left Nantes for Paris Saint-Germain. Landreau clinched the 2008 French League Cup during his three years in the capital, but even greater successes lay ahead at Lille, where he won a league and cup double in 2011.\\r\\nWearing the gloves for Bastia since 2012, Landreau returned to the France fold under Didier Deschamps after a five-year absence, though he remains third in the pecking order behind Hugo Lloris and Steve Mandanda.

He is the perfect example of a modern goalkeeper: while his exceptional reflexes and penalty area domination are enough to set him apart as a top-class all-round custodian, it is Neuer\u2019s unerringly accurate long-distance throws to team-mates that make him truly unique, allowing him to swiftly launch attacks both for his club Bayern Munich and the German national team.\\r\\nThe Gelsenkirchen native\u2019s path into the game started as a five-year-old with Schalke and he made his Bundesliga debut for the club 15 years later, before swiftly making the Royal Blues\u2019 No1 jersey his own. Neuer signed for Bayern in summer 2011 and in subsequent seasons has been a key part of the club\u2019s triumphs in winning a host of domestic honours as well as the UEFA Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup titles.Neuer first made international headlines in 2009 when he lifted the U-21 European Championship crown with Germany. Just a year later he was Joachim Low\u2019s first choice in the senior side at the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 South Africa after previous incumbent Rene Adler pulled out through injury. Neuer took full advantage of the opportunity and has been the country\u2019s undisputed No1 ever since. He was named as Germany\u2019s Player of the Year in 2011 and was voted on to the FIFA/FIFPro World XI two years later. \u201cWe can go to the World Cup full of self-belief,\u201d Neuer told in an exclusive interview just a few months ago, determined to help Germany, bronze medallists at the two most recent finals, win the Trophy for a fourth time. "}, {"Ron-Robert ZIELER": "Ron-Robert Zieler\u2019s sharp reflexes and ability to dominate his penalty area have helped turn him into one of Germany\u2019s best goalkeepers. He is often cited alongside Manuel Neuer as the prototype of a modern custodian, thanks to his ease in possession, his willingness to receive the ball and initiate moves from the back, as well as doubling up as a sweeper to nip opposition attacks in the bud.\\r\\nZieler joined Cologne as a ten-year-old and went on to represent Germany at youth level while at the club. Six years later he moved to Manchester United, where he trained in the reserves, but returned to Germany in summer 2010 after struggling to break through in England. Since then he has made the No1 jersey his own at Bundesliga side Hannover 96.\\r\\nThe shot-stopper was involved in the national set-up in every age category from U-16 through to U-20, with his greatest success so far coming at Germany\u2019s triumphant U-19 European Championship campaign in 2008. Having demonstrated his top-class range of talents at the FIFA U-20 World Cup Egypt 2009, Zieler was handed his senior debut away to Ukraine in November 2011 and was also included in Germany\u2019s UEFA EURO 2012 squad. National team coach Joachim Low clearly has faith in his abilities, with Zieler travelling to Brazil as a highly-dependable back-up.

One of just a handful of domestic-based Black Stars called up for FIFA World Cup duty, Adams earned his place in the squad for Brazil 2014 with brilliant performances during the CAF African Nations Championship in 2014, in which\\xa0he conceded just one goal in six matches en route to a second-placed finish.

He has since been linked with a move to greener pastures in South Africa. Adams is capable of pulling off breathtaking saves from close range, amply making up for his smaller frame. It\u2019s precisely this quality that Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah recognised in Adams as he penned the keeper\u2019s name on his squad list for Brazil, four years after the disappointment of being one of the last dropped for South Africa 2010. "}, {"Adam KWARASEY": "Tall and commanding in the air, Adam Kwarasey is an imposing figure. Born in Norway, he has been tipped by many to become a goalkeeping great for Ghana, but he played just twice in Brazil 2014\\xa0qualifying while spending most of his time on the bench as understudy to Fatawu Dauda. However, the 26-year-old keeper will have done his chances of becoming first-choice no harm by captaining Norwegian club side Stromsgodset to their first league title since 1973 and being named the league\u2019s top goalkeeper for 2013.\\r\\nKwarasey\\xa0has, at times,\\xa0been criticised for hesitating to come off his line. He lined up once for Norway as a youth international, but he turned down further opportunities to play for the Scandinavian country and opted instead to hold out hope for a chance with his beloved Black Stars. His first cap came after a long wait in 2011 when he took the pitch for a CAF Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Swaziland. "}, {"Fatawu DAUDA": "A compact goalkeeper with quick reflexes and experience, Dauda is a natural fit in the ultra-athletic Ghana backline.\\xa0 He was a bit-part player for the Black Stars until the beginning of 2013, when he suddenly found himself thrust into the top position at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations. He was the most-used goalkeeper in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifiers too, lining up in the all-important 6-1 thrashing of Egypt that all but guaranteed the west Africans their third consecutive appearance at the world finals.\\r\\nThe 29-year-old joined South African club Orlando Pirates at the start of the 2013/14 season, but he had to wait nearly half a year before appearing in his first competitive match for the Buccaneers. And though he acquitted himself well, there remain calls in the west African country for a move to a club where he could secure regular playing time.

The\\xa0goalkeeper made his international debut in early 2012 but was not part of the squad that travelled to UEFA EURO 2012. Coach Fernando Santos decided that Karnezis was to be his No1 throughout Brazil 2014 qualifying after he impressed in a friendly against Norway, and the\\xa0Portuguese coach was rewarded with a series of fine displays. The former Panathinaikos man kept a remarkable eight clean sheets in European Group G as Greece finished second behind free-scoring Bosnia-Herzegovina.  At club level, he appeared once in Panathinaikos\u2019s title-winning campaign of 2009/10, but became a regular in the 2011/12 season, picking up the league\u2019s award for goalkeeper of the year, which he retained a year later. His impressive performances at club and international level were enough to pique the interest of Italian side Udinese, who signed him in 2013 but immediately loaned him out to feeder club Granada in Spain, where he has found first-team opportunities limited. "}, {"Panagiotis GLYKOS": "Panagiotis Glykos has made a late case for inclusion into the Greek squad, surprising many by usurping Michail Sifakis to take the third goalkeeper spot behind Orestis Karnezis and Stefanos Kapino. The PAOK stopper comes into the tournament in solid form, keeping a clean sheet once every three Greek Super League games during the 2013/14 season. Fernando Santos gave Glykos his debut back in March in a friendly against Korea Republic and was impressed enough to include him among his final 23 in Brazil. The stopper began his career at Olympiacos, playing in their youth and reserve teams before signing for PAOK in 2007. He was then shipped out on loan, making a handful of appearances, before establishing himself in the first team fold in the 2011/12 season. From then, he has regularly done battle with the other stoppers in the squad to secure the No1 spot. In fact, at the start of the 2013/14 season, he began the league campaign on the bench, with Spaniard Jacobo preferred, before being handed the first team reins in November.

The tall goalkeeper became the youngest player to represent the national side at senior level, making his debut in a 2011 friendly against Romania at the age of 17 years and 241 days, this coming after he was the youngest to represent his country at U-17 level, at 15. His full Greece debut came in a whirlwind period for Kapino at the end of 2011, as he made his top-flight bow for Greek giants Panathinaikos in September of that year.

Despite turning professional with Real Comayagua nearly two decades ago, his reflexes and distribution not only remain intact, but couple perfectly with the experience that he has gained over the years. His main strength is as a shot-stopper and is particularly impressive when defending his goal from close range. Valladares is also very skilled with his feet and has been known to play up front on occasion.\\xa0  Valladares has spent his entire career in his homeland, where he made his professional debut aged 18. Two years later he took a step up by joining Motagua, one of Honduras\u2019 most traditional teams. He picked up five titles between 1995 and 2000, the year when he made his senior debut for his country against Haiti in a qualifier for the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan. Since then, he has made the No1 jersey his own, appearing 53 times for his country over four different World Cup qualifying campaigns. Moreover, he was a key member of the team that put  back on the world stage at South Africa 2010 after a 28-year absence, before helping secure their qualification for Brazil 2014.\\xa0  As captain and mainstay of his national team, his contribution will be key to Honduras\u2019 attempts to survive the group stage in Brazil. "}, {"Donis ESCOBER": "The generation you belong to can change everything. Just ask Donis Escober. Despite having all the attributes to be a first-choice international goalkeeper, he has long found himself playing second fiddle to Noel Valladares, Honduras's second most capped player of all time. Escober has spent his entire career at Olimpia, one of the biggest clubs in Honduras, having burst onto the scene as a 20-year-old back in 2001. His personal highlight at club level was undoubtedly the 2012 season, when he went 833 minutes without conceding, falling just 35 minutes short of breaking Roger Mayorga's 1976 record for the most time a keeper has gone unbeaten in the Honduran top flight. Though he earned his first senior call-up just a year after rising to prominence, the custodian \u2013 who is known for his poise when coming for crosses and his physical strength \u2013 has had to settle for being a perennial understudy at international level, making just 20-odd appearances over more than a decade.

It was with the fast-growing team that he established himself as a promising shot-stopper, including tasting his first league championship during the 2006/07 season.  That feat proved just a prelude to a flow of achievements. After moving to Sepahan in 2008, Ahmadi went on excel in his role between the sticks as his side twice won the domestic title. Understandably, his outstanding club form earned him a first national team call-up during the 2008 West Asian Football Federation Championship, including a start in the final as Iran edged Jordan to the title.  Despite a spell away from , his chance at a return came when former Iran keeper Mehdi Rahmati announced his temporary retirement in 2013.

A product of the Persepolis youth academy, Haghighi made his debut for the Tehran giants against Saipa at the tender age of 18 in 2006, when he famously saved a penalty by the legendary Ali Daei. When first-choice keepers Misagh Memarzadeh and Mehdi Vaezi were sidelined due to injuries in 2008/09, he jumped at the chance and made the number one jersey his own. He became Persepolis' youngest ever captain during the 2010/11 season, skippering his side to a 2-1 defeat of Saipa. He proved something of a trail-blazer in 2011 when he was signed by Rubin Kazan, making him the first-ever Iranian to play in the Russian Premier League. He is still only the second Iranian goalkeeper to play professionally in Europe, following Nima Nakisa who spent years in Albania and Greece.  "}, {"Daniel DAVARI": "Carlos Queiroz has spared no effort in seeking overseas recruitments since taking over Iran in 2011. He secured the services of both English-based Reza Ghoochannejhad and Ashkan Dejagah, who played prominent roles in their successful passage to the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122. Even after his qualifying mission was complete, the Portuguese manager continued his search for foreign-based players eligible to play for Iran. His latest revelation is Daniel Davari, the 26-year-old German-based goalkeeper.  Born in Germany and starting his career with 1. FSV Mainz 05, Davari moved to Eintracht Braunschweig in 2009. When first choice Marjan Petkovic was missing early in the 2011/2012 season, he rose to the occasion, excelling throughout to help his side clinch promotion to the Bundesliga.  Queiroz called up Davari at the start of 2013 but his debut for Iran did not come until last November, keeping a clean sheet as his side beat Thailand 3-0 in a 2015 AFC Asian Cup qualifier. He went on to feature in their 4-1 defeat of Lebanon in the same campaign, before also playing in a friendly against Guinea which Iran lost by 2-1.

Since winning the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122 and being voted best goalkeeper during that tournament, he has taken over the captain's armband \u2013 one of Cesare Prandelli\u2019s first decisions when he became coach in 2010. Imperious on his line and a commanding presence in the box, the 36-year-old has lost none of his edge and has no plans to hang up his gloves just yet.\\xa0 With his tall, slender frame, Buffon was always destined to be a goalkeeper. Capable of making the most difficult saves look easy, especially from point-blank range, there is no apparent weakness in his game. Perhaps one of his main qualities is an ability to put any rare errors he makes to the back of his mind and focus on the match again. Buffon made his  debut away against Russia on 29 October 1997. The following year, he travelled to the 1998 World Cup in France as Italy's second-choice keeper. He made his mark at Korea/Japan 2002 by saving a penalty in Italy's fateful golden-goal elimination by Korea Republic in the Round of 16.  That disappointment was forgotten at Germany 2006, however, when Buffon won his first major international trophy. The then 28-year-old had a vital part to play in Italy's penalty shoot-out win in the Final against France, keeping out Zinedine Zidane's extra-time header with a superb leaping save and then winning a bout of spot-kick mind games with his  team-mate David Trezeguet, forcing the Frenchman to change his usual penalty-taking technique. On 11 October 2013, the evergreen shot-stopper surpassed Fabio Cannavaro to become \u2019s most capped player.

Curiously, Sirigu was keen on being a forward in his youth, but as he suffered from mild asthma attacks that prevented him from keeping up with play \u2013 and was also equipped with very large hands \u2013 his coaches suggested he take up the gloves instead. A natural in the role, Sirigu gained his break as Palermo's third-choice keeper for the 2006/07 campaign, relying on the UEFA Cup for playing time. For two consecutive seasons, he then honed his skills out on loan, first at third-tier Cremonese and next at second-division Ancona, before finally getting a proper chance to shine for Palermo. His progress has been remarkable ever since, even if he missed out on the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122, with Marcello Lippi considering him fourth choice.

Currently on the books of Standard Liege in Belgium, Kawashima began his professional career with J.League side Omiya Ardija after finishing high school. Kawashima transferred to Nagoya Grampus in 2004, where he found himself competing for game time with Seigo Narazaki, a keeper who had played at the 2002 World Cup. Unable to dislodge his more experienced team-mate, Kawashima signed for Kawasaki Frontale in 2007. This move brought almost instant success, and Kawashima made his international debut the following year. After a string of sparkling performances at South Africa 2010, his services were procured by Belgian club Lierse.  Known as a vocal and uncompromising keeper, Kawashima has modelled his playing style on Italian legend Gianluigi Buffon, whom he closely watched during a short stay in Italy early in his career.  Kawashima came of age at South Africa 2010, not least for the way in which he marshalled his defence. In the Round-of-16 game against Paraguay, he kept the South Americans at bay for 120 minutes but was unable to prevent his side losing on penalties. Since then, the 31-year-old has proven to be a remarkable penalty-stopper. At the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, for example, Kawashima saved two spot-kicks against Korea Republic in the semi-final shoot-out.

Nishikawa\u2019s spot at Hiroshima was filled by Takuto Hayashi, who had been selected for Japan in an international friendly in 2012, albeit without playing.  Nishikawa is the heir apparent of the seemingly immovable Blue Samurai goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima. A product of the Oita Trinita youth academy, Nishikawa was a solid performer in national age-category teams, including at the FIFA U-20 World Cup 2005. He also made his professional debut for Oita that year, and soon became the club\u2019s top goalkeeper.  He was selected for the Japan squad the following year but did not play, and was between the sticks at the 2008 Beijing Olympics for all three of Japan\u2019s group-stage defeats. Nishikawa made his full international debut in 2009, but this delight was tempered by Oita\u2019s demotion that season.  After shifting to Hiroshima in 2010, Nishikawa was considered unlucky not to be included in Japan\u2019s squad to the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122. Since that tournament, he has been a constant back-up to Kawashima and keeps the incumbent on his toes.  Nishikawa enjoyed a banner year in 2012, when he was instrumental in helping Sanfrecce win their maiden J.League crown and was chosen in the J.League Best XI.

Tokyo born and bred, Gonda came through the FC Tokyo youth programme and joined the senior team in 2007. Although Tokyo were relegated to the second division in 2010, they rebounded the following season, with Gonda taking on an increasingly important leadership role in the process. \\r\\nGonda regularly represented Japan at U-20 and U-23 levels, and played for the senior national team once in 2010. He was also his country\u2019s first-choice keeper at the London Olympics in 2012, where his compatriots finished fourth. These highs have been offset by occasional lows, including missing qualification for the FIFA U-20 World Cup.  The 25-year-old was inspired to become a goalkeeper after watching former USA shot-stopper Tony Meola, as well as modelling himself on legendary Danish custodian Peter Schmeichel. Unafraid to put his body on the line, Gonda\u2019s undoubted potential has been duly noted by Samurai Blue coach Alberto Zaccheroni.

That was the moment he still remembers as the most difficult one so far in his career, but the following year saw Lee concede a crucial 120th-minute winner shortly after he was brought on for a potential shootout in the semi-final against\\xa0 United Arab Emirates during the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China.\\r\\nHowever, Lee had established himself at Busan by the time he returned to the national team for the 2012 Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament in London, where he rose to the occasion by coming on as a second-half substitute to deny Daniel Sturridge\u2019s decisive penalty in the shootout during the quarter-final against Great Britain. Although he could not keep Brazil from scoring three unanswered goals in the semi-finals, Lee came home with his head held high after winning the bronze medal. "}, {"Jose CORONA": "Jose de Jesus Corona has earned a reputation as one of the best goalkeepers in Mexican football. The custodian already has top-level international experience, having been reserve goalkeeper to Oswaldo Sanchez at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany\u2122, and has proven to be a consistent performer whenever he has played for . However, Corona has yet to make the Mexican\\xa0No1 jersey his own and is\\xa0currently involved in an intriguing tussle for supremacy with\\xa0Guillermo Ochoa, who is likewise in outstanding form with French club\\xa0Ajaccio.\\xa0 For the last few years, several coaches have alternated between the two and even for a brief period they were replaced by Moises Munoz before resuming their perennial fight for a spot, and it is quite likely that coach Herrera will not make a decision until Mexico's first game at Brazil 2014. "}, {"Alfredo TALAVERA": "In the last few years, Alfredo Talavera has not been left out of many national squads. However, with Jose de Jesus Corona and Guillermo Ochoa both on excellent runs of form, the Toluca goalkeeper has had very few opportunities to show what he can do at this level. One did eventually arise, however. As Ochoa was suspended for having accidentally ingested clenbuterol and Corona had been dropped from the squad for disciplinary issues, Talavera was handed the jersey in the run-up to the CONCACAF Gold Cup 2011, and he went on to perform well in the Mexicans\u2019 victory over rivals USA in the continental final. But when his absent compatriots were brought back into the fold, he returned to his previous role of third-choice custodian, safe in the knowledge that he was capable of stepping in whenever necessary. "}, {"Guillermo OCHOA": "Since making his debut in the Mexican top flight at the tender age of 18, Guillermo Ochoa has always been regarded as one of his country\u2019s top goalkeepers. However, his experiences with the national team have been bittersweet at times. Third-choice goalkeeper at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany\u2122, he looked set to be given the nod at South Africa 2010 but, to the surprise of many, Mexico coach Javier Aguirre placed his confidence in veteran Oscar Perez instead. The situation did not change for Ochoa during the Brazil 2014 qualifiers. Ochoa alternated between time between the posts and time on the bench, and he was even sidelined from the team for a short period of time by then coach Jose Manuel de la Torre. However, Ochoa was up to the task in the games in which he saw action and such good performances, coupled with his excellent stint with the French side Ajaccio, making him a candidate for earning a starting spot for  in Brazil. It is as yet unclear which keeper will start Mexico's\\xa0opening match at Brazil 2014, but there is no doubt that, if Ochoa is selected, the\\xa0nation will be in safe hands. "}, {"Jasper CILLESSEN": "The name of Jasper Cillesen remains unfamiliar to many, and it is likely that this young goalkeeper will begin Brazil 2014 as one of the Netherlands\u2019 reserves. It seems equally likely, however, that Cillesen\u2019s fame and international status will continue to rise in the years to come. The evidence of the 2013/14 season, in which 25-year-old became Ajax\u2019s No1 goalkeeper and shone in the Amsterdam giants\u2019 title charge, would certainly suggest as much. Cillesen\u2019s fine form was one of the key factors in Frank de Boer\u2019s side achieving the best defensive record in the Netherlands, and helped justify the faith shown in him by the club three years earlier. That was when Ajax paid \u20ac3 million to prise the then 22-year-old from NEC, the club with which he first made his name. Cillesen had already forced his way into the Netherlands U-21 side by that time, and senior recognition has since followed, with Louis van Gaal handing him his debut in June 2013.  Van Gaal\u2019s faith in the young keeper was displayed more recently when he was named in the starting line-up to face France in March, and this rising star is sure to provide genuine competition for his more experienced rivals. "}, {"Michel VORM": "An unused squad member at both the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 and UEFA EURO 2012, Michel Vorm will be hoping that Brazil 2014 finally offers him a chance to shine on the biggest stage of all. At 30, the Swansea City keeper is the most experienced of the contenders to claim Maarten Stekelenburg\u2019s No1 shirt, but even he has won only 14 caps to date.  The first of those came in 2008, during Vorm\u2019s time with Utrecht, and he has played infrequently for the national team in the years since. His first run as first-choice arrived last September and October with a sequence of three consecutive World Cup qualifiers under Louis van Gaal, raising hopes that he would be the man between the sticks in Brazil.  Experimentation with candidates for the position has since followed, though, and Vorm has contended himself with continuing the fine form that has made him a firm favourite of Swansea\u2019s supporters. His expertise in stopping penalties is particularly renowned in England, with the keeper himself attributing his fine record in such situations to analysing the technique of future opponents. Now he will hope for the chance to show his reflexes and nerves of steel in Brazil as the Dutch aim to emulate their impressive 2010 campaign. "}, {"Tim KRUL": "Brave and agile, Tim Krul has established himself over recent seasons as one of the English Premier League\u2019s most consistent goalkeepers.  Though still just 26, he has earned his place as the undisputed No1 at Newcastle United, the club he joined from ADO Den Haag in the summer of 2005. It took loan spells with Carlisle United and Scottish side Falkirk to help gain Krul the necessary experience to force his way into the Magpies\u2019 starting line-up, but since earning his first opportunity in 2010 there has been no shifting him. Indeed, while Newcastle have endured a largely forgettable 2013/14 campaign, Krul has remained impressive, even winning the Premier League player of the month award for November \u2013 the only goalkeeper this season to have picked up such an honour.  At international level, he has progressed through the ranks, starring at U-17 and U-21 level before making his senior debut against Brazil in 2011. More caps have since followed, including an appearance against Turkey during the Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign. Nonetheless, Krul has recently fallen out of favour with Louis van Gaal and will be desperate to regain his place ahead of the FIFA World Cup\u2122. "}, {"Vincent ENYEAMA": "In a side prone to risk-taking down both flanks, veteran goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama has proven himself adept at rescuing Nigeria's defenders when the occasion calls. An expert\\xa0shot-stopper\\xa0with great\\xa0acrobatic ability, Enyeama has occasionally been hurt by lapses in concentration, but is capable of pulling off spectacular saves, as he proved at the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122, when he won two Man of the Match awards in Nigeria\u2019s three matches. Indeed, his performances in defeats against Argentina and Greece in South Africa were arguably among the best in the recent history of the World Cup. \\r\\n A popular figure in the country and the team, 'The Cat' has been the consistent first choice for over a decade, playing in 28 out of 30 World Cup qualifiers that the Super Eagles have contested since 2006. Enyeama\u2019s record in the CAF Africa Cup of Nations is equally impressive,\\xa0having helped\\xa0the Super Eagles to third-place finishes in the 2004, 2006 and 2010 tournaments and to their third continental trophy in 2013. \\r\\n In the AFCON in South Africa last year, he served as captain in the absence of Joseph Yobo, and was named goalkeeper of the tournament. He has a reputation for being particularly strong against penalties, and has even been known to convert a few himself.  \\r\\nEnyeama has earned a good amount of high-level club experience as well. He won the CAF Champions League twice with Nigerian club Enyimba before moving to Israel in 2005, where he played in the UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League. Having attracted attention from a number of clubs, Enyeama signed for French champions Lille in 2011 but went back to Israel on loan. Since returning to France at the start of the 2013/4 season, he has impressed as Lille's first choice keeper in a successful season that saw the club qualify for European football. "}, {"Austine EJIDE": " Although Austin Ejide has been virtually ever-present in the Nigerian squad since first playing for the Super Eagles in 2002, his playing time has been limited. The 30-year-old has struggled to get past the national team's regular number one, Vincent Enyeama.  \\r\\nA veteran of two FIFA World Cups\u2122 as well as five CAF Africa Cup of Nations campaigns, Ejide has played just four matches at these finals. That was during the 2008 Cup of Nations campaign, when the then Nigeria coach Berti Vogts preferred him to Enyeama, saying he wanted Ejide's height and strength. Last year he was an unused sub when Nigeria won their third continental title at the Cup of Nations in South Africa, and likewise at the FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil. \\r\\n Ejide started his professional career with Gabros International in Nigeria before being signed by Etoile Sportive du Sahel. He twice played in CAF Champions League final with the Tunisian club but ended up on the losing side both times. After four years in North Africa, he moved to Europe, where he signed for French club Bastia. After struggling to make the first team, he joined Hapoel Petach Tikva in Israel, spending several successful seasons with the club. He then moved within the Israeli league to Hapoel Be'er Sheva when his former club was relegated, and this year helped the club to qualify for the Europa League by finishing second. "}, {"Chigozie AGBIM": " One of the best goalkeepers in the Nigerian Premier League over the last few seasons, Chigozie Agbim is a popular figure and is considered a capable and improving third-choice for the Super Eagles. Agile, powerful and adept at being in the right position, Agbim also has leadership qualities.  \\r\\nHe is one of several players featuring in the local league whom coach Stephen Keshi has roped in for regular international duty. His favoured role with the \u2018Big Boss\u2019 has won him a handful of international caps since debuting in January of 2012 against Angola.  \\r\\nAgbim was in Nigeria's squad for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, as well as the FIFA Confederations Cup. Like Nigeria's other reserve goalkeeper, Austin Ejide, he has though found it impossible to get past Vincent Enyeama and has yet to play for the Super Eagles in a FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifier or Africa Cup of Nations match. \\r\\n Agbim was released by Enugu Rangers earlier in the year after the club found his many absences while on international duty to be too disruptive. The 29-year-old, who played in goal for Nigeria at the African Nations Championship \u2013 a competition for which only locally-based players are eligible \u2013 earlier this year, has since joined Gombe United. "}, {"EDUARDO": "If there is one image from the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 that Portuguese fans will never forget, it is of goalkeeper Eduardo sitting on the pitch with tears running down his cheeks. Despite his valiant attempts to keep the team in the tournament, Portugal had just lost to the eventual champions Spain in the Round of 16. Before that Eduardo had gone three games in the group stage without conceding a goal and then kept a clean sheet for 63 minutes of the clash with his country\u2019s great rivals from the Iberian Peninsula. Finally though, David Villa found a way past him, destroying Portuguese dreams and bringing to an end the keeper\u2019s reign as his country\u2019s number one. Eduardo is the perfect example of how the life of a footballer can change almost overnight. After making the Braga No1 shirt his own at the beginning of the 2008/09 season, his terrific performances in the Primeira Liga and the UEFA Cup established him as an athlete with a knack for taking advantage of opportunities when they came his way. \\r\\nHe made his debut for the national team during the qualifying campaign for the 2010 World Cup, and was instrumental as Portugal booked their place in South Africa, before going on to shine at the tournament itself. But in 2011/12 his club Genoa loaned him to Benfica for a year. He hardly played a game for the Lisbon team, and subsequently lost his position in the national side. He then spent a year at Istanbul BB before returning to Braga, and remains a more than capable reserve for the national team "}, {"Rui PATRICIO": "First impressions last, as they say. On the pitch, they can play an important part in defining a player\u2019s future by revealing talent and highlighting weaknesses. Sporting fans have been forming their impressions of Rui Patricio since he made his first team debut in the Primeira Liga aged just 18, when the team\u2019s other goalkeepers were ruled out through suspension and injury. And what a debut it was. The keeper was instrumental in an away victory over Maritimo, even saving a penalty to secure a 1-0 win. The following summer he played for Portugal at the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, where the team reached the quarter-finals. And ever since the 2007/08 season Rui Patricio has been Sporting\u2019sfirst choice goalkeeper. Through good times and bad he has been a consistent presence between the posts, identifying and correcting his own mistakes and developing as a player in the best way possible: by playing. It hasn\u2019t all been plain sailing, however. Although he was part of Luiz Felipe Scolari\u2019s squad at UEFA EURO 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, he didn\u2019t get on the pitch. And he was then left out of the squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122. \\r\\nBut things soon started to look up. When he took over as coach of Portugal during the qualifying campaign for UEFA EURO 2012, Paulo Bento had no qualms about making Patricio his first choice goalkeeper. After all, the coach had been responsible for giving him his Sporting debut all those years ago. And the 'keeper's response could not have been better. He was brilliant at the European Championship, where Portugal reached the semi-finals, and remained first choice for the qualifying campaign for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. At the relatively young age of 26, with eight seasons playing at the highest level for Sporting behind him, Rui Patricio has the experience and talent needed to shine in Brazil. "}, {"BETO": "It\u2019s fair to say that Beto has earned his success the hard way. His dedication and patience have led to the keeper being selected for two FIFA World Cups\u2122. Despite coming through Sporting's youth system, the goalkeeper never played for the first team. His displays for the club\u2019s B team, however, led to a move to Leixoes in 2006/07, where he played a key role as the club from Matosinhos won promotion. In the following two seasons Beto was able to display his talents at the highest level, becoming an automatic first choice for Leixoes. He also revealed a knack for saving spot kicks, and was the hero when Leixoes eliminated Benfica from the Taca de Portugal on penalties. In 2008/09 he made a big step, signing for the then Portuguese champions Porto. He faced stiff competition for the number one jersey at his new club, in the shape of Brazilian international Helton. But he certainly took advantage of his opportunities, which were generally limited to games in the Taca de Portugal. His incredible performance against Belenenses, when he saved five spot kicks in the penalty shoot-out, was particularly memorable. \\r\\nHe eventually left Porto to play in Romania, then returned to Portugal with Braga before moving to Sevilla, where he has enjoyed two successful seasons. Even if he is not first choice for the national team, fans know that, if needed, Beto will rise to the occasion in Brazil in 2014 "}, {"Igor AKINFEEV": "In a country which has produced such luminaries of the custodian\u2019s art as Lev Yashin and Rinat Dassayev, pulling on the national-team\u2019s No1 jersey has proved an overwhelming burden for many contenders. Yet despite first being handed this responsibility aged just 18, Igor Akinfeev has handled the pressure in exemplary fashion \u2013 taking the step in his stride and showing himself a worthy successor to Russia\u2019s former goalkeeping greats.  Even as a youngster, Akinfeev was already tipped by many as a future senior national-team keeper and wasted little time in making that prediction a reality. By 15 he was in Russia\u2019s U-21 squad and made his full international debut in April 2004, starting a friendly versus Norway only 20 days after turning 18. It was a starting berth that, with the exception of spells sidelined through injury, he has clung onto for the ten years since. Akinkeev\u2019s rise was similarly meteoric in his beloved CSKA Moscow, a club he has been a part of from the age of four. First in first-team action at 16 back in 2003, his years of loyal service have been generously replete with silverware \u2013 including four Russian titles, six domestic cups and the 2005 UEFA Cup \u2013 as well as individual honours aplenty, such as being voted Russia\u2019s goalkeeper of the year on successive occasions. At international level, Akinfeev spent his first major tournament, UEFA EURO 2004, on the bench, though was a key figure in the eastern Europeans\u2019 charge to the continental semi-finals four years later. Again on the bench at EURO 2012, having only recently recovered from major knee surgery, he was back as Russia\u2019s rock-solid last line of defence during their successful qualifying campaign for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122.  \\r\\nNow 28, Akinfeev seems both well-aware of and at ease with his status as a national-team icon. And prior to being a World Cup Ambassador at Russia 2018, Brazil 2014 should provide the vastly experienced keeper with his first taste of life at a World Cup \u2013 a stage Yashin and Dassayev graced in such style. \\r\\n"}, {"Yury LODYGIN": "Fabio Capello must be delighted with the goalkeepers at his disposal for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, particularly since Yuriy Lodygin\u2019s recent decision to represent Russia instead of Greece.  Boasting dual nationality, the custodian was born near Moscow yet lived in Greece \u2013 his mother\u2019s homeland \u2013 until the age of 23. The decision about\\xa0national team representation came to a head in August 2013, when he turned down a call-up from Greece\\xa0coach Fernando Santos with a view to competing for Russia.  Nor was it long since the keeper\u2019s career had undergone a remarkably rapid turnaround. Having come through a difficult start in the Greek third tier, Lodygin\u2019s top-flight breakthrough season was 2012/13 at modest outfit Skoda Xanthi. From there he was snapped up by big-spending Zenit St. Petersburg, where he wasted little time in wresting a starting spot from fans\u2019 favourite Vyacheslav Malafeev, while underlining his huge potential in the club\u2019s run to the UEFA Champions League Round of 16.  \\r\\nHis decision to return to the country of his birth has proven very wise, with Capello calling him up for the first time in October 2013. And though he made no appearances in the successful Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign, the consistently rave reviews he receives for his displays suggest Igor Akinfeev may need to look over his shoulder sooner rather than later \u2013 a situation Capello would surely relish. \\r\\n"}, {"Sergey RYZHIKOV": "Russia goalkeeper Sergei Ryzhikov has had to wait patiently for his chance to shine. The Rubin Kazan custodian had turned 30 by the time he received his first call-up for his country and is now preparing for his first major international tournament at the age of 33. Born in Belgorod, Ryzhikov made his professional debut with his local club at the age of 19, though it was not until he joined to Anzhi Makhachkala in 2005 that he began to make a name for himself in the Russian Premier League. A transfer to Lokomotiv Moscow followed the very next season, though he failed to see much in the way of first-team action in the Russian capital. After a spell on loan with Tom Tomsk, he made the move that would change his career for good, joining Rubin Kazan in 2008 and finally holding down a starting place. The winner of two league titles with his club, Ryzhikov earned an invitation to the national side thanks in no small part to some fine performances in the UEFA Champions League, though his debut cap did not come until March 2011 and a friendly against Qatar.\\xa0 While his chances of making an appearance in Fabio Capello\u2019s side at Brazil 2014 seem to be slim, Russia fans know very well that Ryzhikov can be relied upon to perform should he be called into action.

His age was an important factor in his limited outings with the 27-time Swiss champions, where he was restricted to just 23 appearances in three years.  In 2002 Benaglio moved to Germany with VfB Stuttgart but the then 19-year-old was only third-choice goalkeeper behind Timo Hildebrand and Thomas Ernst. Benaglio was forced to settle for a place in the reserves, who played in the third division at the time. Given the shot-stopper\u2019s burning ambition to succeed, that was not good enough and he was soon on the move again.\\r\\nIn July 2005 Benaglio joined Portuguese islanders CD Nacional Funchal and after some initial teething problems he established himself as the club\u2019s No1. His consistently good performances swiftly attracted the attention of several European sides and in January 2008 German Bundesliga outfit VfL Wolfsburg recruited the Zurich native.  Benaglio\u2019s greatest achievement to date was helping Wolfsburg defy the odds to win their first ever Bundesliga title in 2008/09. \\r\\nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 will be Benaglio\u2019s fifth major international tournament. After making his senior Switzerland debut in a friendly against China PR on 3 June 2006, Benaglio was included in his country\u2019s Germany 2006 squad but was behind Pascal Zuberbuhler and Fabio Coltorti in the pecking order. \\r\\nHowever, at UEFA EURO 2008 Benaglio played in all three group stage games but was unable to prevent the side crashing out of the competition at the first hurdle, a fate that also befell the team at South Africa 2010 and at the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament at London 2012, where Benaglio captained the side.

The goalkeeper is extremely difficult to beat, an expert at saving penalties and strong in one-on-one situations, making him a highly competent understudy to No1 Diego Benaglio. \\r\\nSommer signed his first professional contract in 2005 at FC Basel, but after struggling to make an impact was loaned to Liechtenstein outfit FC Vaduz and then Grasshoppers Zurich. Now, however, he is the undisputed first-choice custodian in Basel and has been crucial in helping the side pick up a number of trophies.\\r\\nHis displays aroused interest from across Europe, with Borussia Monchengladbach winning the race for his signature as a replacement for the departing Marc-Andre ter Stegen next season. That the Bundesliga club identified Sommer as the ideal man to fill the void is further evidence of his first-rate quality.\\r\\nThe goalkeeper\u2019s first senior cap for Switzerland came in a friendly against Romania on 30 May 2012 after previously captaining his country to the final of the UEFA U-21 Championship 2011.

The custodian made his top-flight debut for the club in 2009 but opted to try his luck elsewhere after finding first-team opportunities hard to come by in the Swiss capital. In early 2011 Burki joined Grasshoppers Zurich on loan and eventually made the No1 jersey there his own.

His senior debut arrived against Ecuador in Quito, in Uruguay\u2019s penultimate qualifying game for the tournament. Muslera has been Uruguay\u2019s go-to man in goal ever since and was crucial to the team\u2019s fourth-placed finish at South Africa 2010 and at the triumphant Copa America a year later before repeated a fourth-place at the Confederations Cup Brazil 2013.

At South Africa 2010, the commanding centre-back played in all three of Algeria\u2019s encounters, but could not prevent them from exiting at the group stage. Earlier that year, he had played a key role in his country\u2019s exciting run to the semi-finals of the CAF Africa Cup of Nations. Born in France, Bougherra chose to represent Algeria after earning a call-up for their U-23 side. He was promoted to the seniors in 2004, during the qualifiers for Germany 2006, and has since developed into a lynchpin of the team. He turned professional at the tender age of 17 with French club Gueugnon, before enjoying spells with English outfits Crewe Alexandra and Sheffield Wednesday. In 2007, he was involved in a high-profile move to Charlton Athletic. One year later, he signed for Scottish heavyweights Rangers, with whom he secured three league titles, a Scottish Cup and a Scottish League Cup, winning over the club\u2019s demanding fans in the process. After three successful seasons in Glasgow, the robust international accepted an offer from Qatari side Lekhwiya, coached by fellow Algerian Djamel Belmadi.

It was in Switzerland that he launched his professional career, however, signing terms with Geneva side Servette in 2003. The following season, Mesbah moved to Basel, winning the Swiss title before being loaned to Lorient in January 2006. Injury nonetheless deprived him of the chance to feature for the club in French Ligue 2, and he returned to Switzerland for a spell with Aarau. From there, the defender switched to Luzern, but he made just a few appearances before deciding to try his luck in Italy. Loaned to Avellino, he contested 27 games in Serie B and weighed in with a pair of goals, after which he spent three years at Lecce. His consistency eventually drew admiring glances from Milan, who brought him on board in 2011. Unable to carve out a regular first-team spot, he opted to continue his career at Parma, from where he joined Livorno on loan in the winter. On the international stage, Mesbah was first called up by Algeria for a friendly against the Republic of Ireland in May 2010. He was awarded his maiden cap in the same game and went on to face England at the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122.

Zabaleta had yet to make his debut with San Lorenzo when he captained his country to fourth place at the FIFA U-17 World Cup Trinidad and Tobago 2001, and no sooner had he got his first taste of life in the Argentinian top flight than he appeared as one of the youngest members of his squad at the FIFA U-20 World Cup UAE 2003, where La Albiceleste once again finished fourth. Two years later Zabaleta was back at the FIFA U-20 world finals, this time in the Netherlands, where he skippered an Argentina side containing the likes of Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero to the title. Just for good measure, he was also the team\u2019s second-highest scorer with three goals. That same season he signed for Espanyol and made his full international debut under Jose Pekerman, though he featured in only one Germany 2006 qualifying match and did not make the trip to the finals. In 2008 he picked up a gold medal at the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament in Beijing only to once again miss out on the world finals, in South Africa in 2010, having played just one qualifier under Alfio Basile and none at all under Diego Maradona. Within a year Zabaleta was impressing as right-back at Manchester City, earning a place in the Argentina squad for the 2011 Copa America and gaining the confidence of Sabella right from the start of his tenure.

A Copa Libertadores winner in 2009, he was a member of the side that took second place at the FIFA Club World Cup in the UAE later that year, turning in a solid performance in the final against Barcelona. After adding the 2010 Torneo Apertura title to his CV, also under Sabella, Rojo signed for Spartak Moscow. Though the defender saw little action with the Russian club in 2011, Sergio Batista handed him his Argentina debut that February and selected him for the Copa America five months later.

An unused substitute in the team that finished runners-up at the FIFA Club World Cup UAE 2009, he was a central plank in the  line-up by the time they won the 2010 Torneo Clausura 2010.  Sergio Batista gave him his first international cap in April 2011 but did not name him in the squad for the Copa America later that year, one in which he joined his current club Napoli after a short loan spell with Getafe in Spain. Though Sabella brought him into the squad after taking over as national team coach, Fernandez stayed on the bench for the first three games of the Brazil 2014 qualifying competition.

While Franjic has been earmarked for a defensive role with the Socceroos, he has played some of the recent domestic season in a more advanced position adding goalscoring to his repertoire.  Franjic has Croatian heritage and played for Melbourne Knights in his teenage years, as did several of Australia\u2019s 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany\u2122 squad, most famously Mark Viduka. Franjic did not make his professional debut until the age of 22 when Brisbane Roar plucked him from the relative obscurity of Melbourne\u2019s semi-professional ranks, having previously made ends meet as a carpenter.

After two seasons he joined rising Dutch Eredivisie side Heracles Almelo where he has become a first-team regular.  He earned his first Socceroo cap against Scotland in 2012 but headed into his own net just four minutes after entering the match as a substitute.

One of the few national team players to hail from the regional city of Geelong, Spiranovic is a cultured ball-playing central defender capable of distributing with confidence from the back. On occasions over the past domestic season he has been pushed into a defensive midfielder role and showed his class by adapting seamlessly.  Spiranovic made the step directly from the academy system in Melbourne to Nuremberg helping the club to a rare German Cup triumph in 2007, playing in the decider despite his tender age. However he played just a handful of games over four seasons and made the move to Urawa Red Diamonds. There followed a stint with Qatar\u2019s Al Arabi which drew some media criticism who interpreted the move as a lack of ambition on Spiranovic\u2019s behalf.

Wright featured for the Joeys as Australia failed to qualify for the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup, however national team honours eluded him until his surprise naming in Postecoglou\u2019s provisional 30-man squad last month for Brazil.  A tall and powerfully built player, Wright is renowned for his aerial ability both in defence and in attack from set-pieces. His leadership skills have been recognised at Deepdale where he has worn the captain\u2019s armband on several occasions despite his youth.

Cherished by City supporters, Kompany helped give them something to celebrate when he captained the club to their 2012 Premier League triumph, and he also ended that landmark campaign voted as Premier League Player of the Season. He has since led City to further glory, adding a League Cup victory and another Premier League winners medal to his collection in 2014.\\r\\nFor his country, Kompany has been a constant presence since shining in his early outings at the age of 18. He feels a deep attachment to the Belgium cause, but there has been plenty of disappointment as well, with  (Red Devils) missing out on tournament after tournament before booking their place at Brazil 2014. Kompany felt frustrated that his team-mates lacked his own soaring levels of ambition and self-confidence, not to mention the composure he displayed just a year into his professional career when he told reporters: \"No player is perfect, but as I hold back from discussing my qualities, I\\'d rather not talk about my faults.\" Having scored twice in qualifying, Kompany is now revelling in the chance to finally lead his compatriots onto the global stage. \\xa0 "}, {"Jan VERTONGHEN": "Often fielded at left-back and sometimes as an old-school stopper, Jan Vertonghen is one of Marc Wilmots\u2019 key players, to the extent that he inherits the captain\u2019s armband when regular skipper Vincent Kompany is not on the pitch. Robust, physical and technically proficient, as well as quick and versatile, he is the archetypal modern defender. Furthermore, he possesses an eye for goal and has been known to fire home powerful free kicks. \\r\\nThe Sint-Niklaas native played youth football for Germinal Beerschot and Ajax, eventually earning a promotion to the latter club\u2019s senior squad, by way of a six month-long loan at RKC Waalwijk. He proceeded to establish himself in the Amsterdam side\u2019s starting XI, attaining his first cap for Belgium and winning trophies \u2013 the 2010 Dutch Cup and the 2011 and 2012 Dutch League titles \u2013 and personal accolades (the 2012 Eredivise Player of the Year award) in the process. Some of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs were chasing his signature, but it was Tottenham Hotspur who won the race.

The imposing centre-back, whose experience, passing accuracy and natural defensive qualities have blended well with the talent and enthusiasm of his younger team-mates, is also a mainstay of the national team.\\r\\nThe son of Franz Van Buyten, a renowned Belgian wrestler, he started out at Charleroi in 1997, spending two seasons with and speedily developing into a highly regarded and talented centre-half. Following a further two convincing seasons with Standard Liege, he joined Marseille.

The centre-back decided at the age of 22 to leave for Russia, joining local giants Zenit St Petersburg, and seven years on from that switch he is still there. In that time, Lombaerts has helped Zenit win the UEFA Cup plus several domestic titles, with his own displays earning him the title of best foreign player in the Russian championship in 2012. \\r\\nStrong in the air and a tough tackler with a cool head under pressure, Lombaerts is a dependable performer for both club and country. He has never been far from the international set-up since making his debut against Saudi Arabia in 2006, though he has often been asked to play at left-back due to Belgium\\'s impressive array of defensive talents. That humility and sense of self-sacrifice round out his qualities, making him a genuine asset to  (Red Devils). \"I\\'m just Nicolas Lombaerts,\" he says, though that is quite a statement in itself. "}, {"Anthony VANDEN BORRE": "Anthony Vanden Borre has experienced more lows than highs since first slipping on the Belgium shirt aged just 16. The lowest moment of all came when Genk opted not to extend his contract in June 2012, and the defender once felt to have the same potential as Vincent Kompany found himself without a club for the next six months. Vanden Borre's path to that point had been littered with injuries and coaches who did not believe in him, yet it is true too that his own approach to the game had not helped his cause. \\xa0\\xa0\\r\\nThe 26-year-old experienced plenty of success early on in his career, and perhaps those breakthroughs came too early. He is adamant that he has learnt from his mistakes, however, and he has certainly seized the opportunity since former club Anderlecht offered him a fresh chance in January 2013. Asked to prove himself with the youth team first, Vanden Borre got down to work without complaints and has now re-established himself as a fixture in the Brussels club's line-up.\\r\\nReunited with his childhood friend Kompany, he is back too in the Belgium fold, having enjoyed intermittent exposure to the international game during the first part of his career. He now hopes to start a new chapter on the greatest stage of all, by bringing his athleticism and technical prowess to bear on the playing fields of Brazil.

With more than 300 top-flight games under his belt, he brings bountiful experience to bear as well. The first of those outings came at Charleroi, where Ciman started out before moving to Club Brugge for a somewhat dispiriting stint. Then a U-21 international, he was loaned out in 2009 to Kortrijk, coached at the time by Georges Leekens, and was subsequently sold to Standard Liege the following year. \\r\\nHaving taken over as Belgium coach, Leekens handed Ciman his first cap against Bulgaria in 2010. The rest have followed intermittently since then, with defenders of the quality of Thomas Vermaelen, Daniel Van Buyten and Vincent Kompany standing in his way.

Despite Braunschweig\u2019s anticipated struggles to compete with Germany\u2019s elite, Bicakcic recovered from a shaky start to the season to put in some admirable performances, including in a 2-0 loss at free-scoring Bayern Munich.  Bicakcic started Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2019s final four Brazil 2014 qualifiers and, after a fine performance against Slovakia, made a crucial block from a Deivydas Matulevicius strike in the ticket-clinching 1-0 win in Lithuania.

Spahic played in his homeland, Croatia and Russia at the start of his club career. In 2006 he joined Lokomotiv Moscow and, operating at left-back, helped them beat FC Moscow 1-0 in the 2007 Russian Cup final. Successful stints at Montpellier and Sevilla ensued, before Spahic signed for Bayer Leverkusen ahead of the 2013/14 season. He impressed in his first term in the Bundesliga and helped Leverkusen keep clean sheets in three of the five matches he played in Group A of the Champions League. In the Round of 16, however, Spahic conceded a penalty and was sent off as the Germans were thrashed by Paris Saint-Germain.

He made his Bundesliga and UEFA Champions League debuts as a teenager in 2012, but it was in the 2013/14 that he made a first-team place his own. Indeed, in Schalke\u2019s final Group E game in the Champions League \u2013 one they had to win to reach the knockout phase \u2013 he produced an infallible performance to neutralize Basel dangerman Mohamed Salah and help Die K\u00f6nigsblauen to a 2-0 victory. \\r\\nKolasinac, a tough-tackling defender who is comfortable in possession, wore the white of Germany at U-18, U-19 and U-20 level.

Vranjes, whose physical player can intimidate opponents, has played club football in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Moldova, Russia and Turkey despite his relative youth.  His best season came in 2011/12, when he helped Krasnador qualify for the Champions Group in the Russian Premier League. Vranjes joined Elaz\u00c4\u00b1gspor at the start of 2014 and despite the team\u2019s struggles, Vranjes has proven himself capable of nullifying the Turkish Super Lig\u2019s top forwards.

Having started out at Bahia, it was after he moved to Spanish La Liga outfit Sevilla \u2013 for whom he made his debut in 2003 \u2013 that his career really took off. By the time he had turned 22 in 2005 he was already considered one of the world\u2019s finest attacking right-backs, with his endless bursts down the flank a key feature of the Sevilla side that over the course of 2006 and 2007 won a Copa del Rey, a Spanish Supercup, two UEFA Cups and a UEFA Supercup.

Playing in the 2004 Brazilian championship, he turned in some impressive performances, and it was on the back of those displays that the tall central defender earned a move to Porto. Sadly, injury and health problems led to him being loaned out to Dynamo Moscow, where further ailments, including a bout of tuberculosis in 2005, prevented him from maintaining full fitness. The following year he was back home in Brazil. As fate would have it his destination was Fluminense, the club that had rejected him years earlier.

A distinctive figure as much for his galloping runs down the flank as his eye-catching hairstyle, he played his first game for the capital club in April 2007 and has made the left flank more or less his own, with versatility and freedom to attack.

There he was one of the standout stars of a spectacular generation that secured a historical third-placed finish. A less positive\\xa0side to his game was also on view\\xa0as he was sent off early on in the semi-final defeat to Argentina.\\xa0Medel's fierce temperament is, without doubt a part of his game and 13 red cards\\xa0in\\xa0his career so far are testament to that fact. After impressing at  and playing some friendly matches for the senior side, Bielsa took Medel to La Paz to play against Bolivia on the road to South Africa. Chile won 2-0, with Medel scoring both goals in his first official match. He shone again at South Africa 2010, but featured as a midfielder when Claudio Borghi took over the following year. Under Sampaoli since 2012, however,  is back biting\\xa0in defence once again and was the star in the qualifiers, playing 12 games for  en route to the World Cup. At the age of just 26, all of Chile hopes he will shine again in Brazil. "}, {"Gonzalo JARA": "Gonzalo Jara is a right-back with good technique, but it\u2019s his versatility that makes him an even more valuable member of Chile\u2019s squad, given that he can also operate on the left, as a centre-back or as a defensive midfielder. A bright future was on the cards for Jara ever since he captained Chile at the 2005 U-20 South American championship in Colombia. That year also saw the full-back further showcase his potential as he played in the U-20 World Cup in Netherlands and was also chosen as the best player at Huachipato, the club where he had arrived just two years earlier as a youth player. 2006 brought a new achievement as Nelson Acosta gave Jara his debut for Chile at just 20 years of age. The following year, he then moved to a big club, Colo-Colo, and went on to win three national titles before establishing himself as a regular under Marcelo Bielsa for Chile in 2009 and securing a transfer to West Bromwich Albion. A starter at the FIFA World Cup South Africa 2010, Jara was suspended for indiscipline in 2011 and subsequently missed ten games. He apologised, however, and returned to play in eight qualifiers en route to Brazil 2014, where he\u2019ll hope to build on his successful season this term with Nottingham Forest.  "}, {"Ousmane DIARRASSOUBA": "After first representing C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire at the 2008 Olympic Football Tournament, where he featured in all four matches the team played before being knocked out at the quarter-final stage by west African rivals Nigeria, Ousmane Viera Diarrassouba had to wait another five years before playing his next competitive game for his country. Although the tall, powerful defender made the squad for all but one of  2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifiers, he featured only once, against Morocco in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire's final Group C game. A possible reason why Diarrassouba, after playing at the Olympics, took so long to become established in the senior side is that he was playing his club football in Romania \u2013 far from the leagues like France, Belgium and England, from which C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire coaches traditionally pick their players for international duty. The 27-year-old started had his professional career with local club RC Daloa, before being snapped up by ambitious Romanian side CFR Cluj. Diarrassouba struggled to break into the side though and moved within the Romanian league to FC International on loan. In 2010, he moved to Pandurii Ctargu Jiu and spent three successful seasons with the club. Likewise a move to Turkey saw him become a mainstay for Caykur Rizesporin the Super Lig.

He has also been ever-present in the CAF Africa Cup of Nations squads since 2006, when C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire reached the final. The 31-year-old was first called up in 2004 and has amassed well over 70 caps since then. Although not big in stature, Boka is known for his pace and hard tackling. Taught the essentials at his hometown club ASEC Abidjan, he was only 16 when he left for Stade Tunisien, whom he represented for three years before joining up with the coterie of Ivorian talent at Beveren. Boka spent two years with the Belgian outfit \u2013 often the first port of call in Europe for graduates of the Jean-Marc Guillou academy \u2013 and reached the Belgian Cup final in 2004.\\r\\nHe then went on to sign\\xa0for French side Strasbourg, winning the French League Cup in his first season. Stuttgart stepped in for his services in the summer of 2006 and a year later Boka was celebrating again, having helped the club clinch the Bundesliga title. He now has over 150 Bundesliga appearances to his name. "}, {"Kolo TOURE": "With over 100 international games for C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, defender Kolo Toure is one of the most experienced players in Africa. A veteran of his country's two previous FIFA World Cup\u2122 finals campaigns, the older of the Toure brothers first broke into the national team in 2000, which allowed him to obtain a work permit when Arsene Wenger wanted to sign him for Arsenal.  At the time Toure was playing for ASEC Mimosas, with whom he had won the CAF Champions League in 1998. He came agonizingly close to adding the UEFA Champions League in 2006, but a 10-man Arsenal side were beaten 2-1 by Barcelona. He is one of several players to have embarked on a successful professional career after going through Jean-Marc Guillou's ASEC Abidjan academy, which he joined as a midfielder. When he emerged after his basic training, he was an athletic, physical, powerful player at right back or in the centre of defence.  A 14-year veteran of the national team, Toure and his world-class brother Yaya form part of an impressive spine of players for, with whom he finished runner-up at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations in 2006 and 2012. "}, {"Didier ZOKORA": "Few players in the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire squad can match Didier Zokora in terms of experience. With well over 100 caps, the midfielder has also played in every match the Elephants' have played at the FIFA World Cup\u2122 finals.  He has also played in 28 qualifying matches, competed in six CAF Africa Cup of Nations and played club football in five European countries, including Spain and England. But had it not been for Gervinho's missed penalty in the 2012 AFCON tournament, Zokora would probably not be in Brazil.  The 33-year-old said at the time that should the west Africans beat Zambia in the final, he would retire from international football. The record shows, however, that Zambia won 8-7 on penalties and even though Zokora retired briefly from international football, he returned just as fast. Zokora is a product of the famous ASEC Mimosas academy, though in part he remembers it tragically as his younger brother Armand drowned whilst celebrating their acceptance to the academy. In memory of his brother, Didier has Armand's name tattooed on his arm.  Currently playing in Turkey with Trabzonspor after stints in Belgium (Racing Genk), France (Saint-Etienne), England (Tottenham Hotspur) and Spain (Sevilla), Zokora says that every game he plays is in memory of his brother. Brazil 2014 will probably offer him the last opportunity to\\xa0 honour him on the global stage. "}, {"Jean Daniel AKPA": "Defender Jean-Daniel Akpa-Akpro is by far the most successful of three French-born brothers, all of whom\\xa0play football - and all called Jean. But while Jean-Daniel has managed to play in Ligue 1 with Toulouse and to be called up for international duty by the country of his parents, his brothers Jean-Louis and Jean-Jacques have not managed to reach those heights. Jean-Louis was called up by the French U-18 side whilst on the books of Toulouse, but had to withdraw injured and has played mainly in the lower tiers of English football, while Jean-Jacques has not played above the third tier of French football. The youngest of the brothers, Jean-Daniel broke into the Toulouse first side as an 18-year-old in 2011 and has been playing regularly ever since. In 2013, he received his first call-up into the Elephants squad and, although he has yet to play a competitive match for the side, he was in the squad for four of the eight FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifiers C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire played en route to Brazil. With age on his side and experience and strength being built, it seems only a matter of time before the 21-year-old establishes himself in his national team. "}, {"Serge AURIER": "Serge Aurier is one of the players considered the future of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\\'s national team and, although he is only 21-years-old, his Toulouse club coach Alain Casanova already rates him as the best right-back in France.  Born in Ouragahio, Aurier moved to France at an early age and came through the youth ranks of Lens, for whom he played his first professional game in 2009, having just turned 17. He stayed with the club until January 2012, when he signed for Toulouse and immediately established himself in the side. He is a versatile player, who feels equally at home playing defensive midfield, in central defence or at right-back. He has a keen eye for goal and in the 2013/14 season, he not only created goals but was one of his club\\'s top scorers. However, being a team player, Aurier is quick to point out that individual statistics mean very little in football. \"I\\'ve got good stats at the moment, but my individual performances aren\\'t the most important thing right now. What is important is the team,\u201d he said. Aurier has established himself as a valuable option for the Elephants after playing his first game for the side in June 2013. He has since taken over the right-back position from veteran Emmanuel Eboue and played in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\\'s five final 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifiers. "}, {"Constant DJAKPA": "Constant Djakpa has steadily risen to prominence in the German Bundesliga thanks to his pace and range of skills. The 27-year-old can play out wide as a conventional attacking winger, but has usually featured at left-back for his current club Eintracht Frankfurt. Djakpa learned the basics in the youth section at Stella Club in his home town of Abidjan. The agile left-footed player graduated to the senior squad and eventually opted to try his hand in Europe. He joined Sogndal in the Norwegian second division in 2006, before signing for Romanian top-flight outfit Pandurii Targu Jiu a year later. Bayer Leverkusen came calling for the Ivorian in 2008, but after his first season the Rhineland side loaned Djakpa to Hannover. The player finally made the breakthrough in the Bundesliga with the Lower Saxony club, and has been more or less a regular since switching to Frankfurt in 2011. He appeared in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire colours at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations 2008 in Ghana. Djakpa, a firm crowd favourite in Frankfurt for his stamina and hard-running determination, is now aiming to bolster his reputation at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122.

He was also in his country's Olympic squad that reached the quarter-finals in Beijing in 2008. In the same year, the athletic defender played for  for the first time, lining up alongside Kolo Toure in the centre of defence. The pair played together at the 2010 CAF Africa Cup of Nations, but he failed to see any match-time at the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 finals, when Didier Zokora was given preference ahead of him.  Since then, Bamba has again featured regularly, and in 2012, Bamba and Toure combined as\\xa0C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire did not concede a single\\xa0goal in open play at Africa Cup of Nations, only to be beaten on penalties by Zambia in the final. Bamba plays his club football in Turkey for Trabzonspor, having joined the club from English Championship side Leicester City. He started his professional career with Paris Saint-Germain in 2004, but failed to break through into the side. He was handed a lifeline by Scottish side Dunfermline, where he got his career on track before moving to Hibernian. "}, {"Benoit ASSOU EKOTTO": "Benoit Assou-Ekotto took his first steps on the professional ladder at French club Lens. Having come up through the youth ranks of the Ligue 1 outfit, the left-back made 73 first-team appearances in four seasons before his move to Tottenham Hotspur in summer 2006. His solidity, intelligent positioning and speed soon made him a regular in the Spurs line-up and he played over 150 games for the team before moving on loan to Queens Park\\xa0Rangers last term. Born in Arras, France, but eligible for Cameroon via his father, Assou-Ekotto first joined up with the Indomitable Lions in February 2009 after heeding the call of then boss Otto Pfister. He was called up for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122\\xa0and played in all three matches as the Indomitable Lions crashed out in the first round with three defeats. His inclusion in the international squad since then has been erratic, but he earned a recall for Cameroon's final qualifier against Tunisia and for the 20th World Cup. "}, {"Nicolas NKOULOU": "It took defender Nicolas N\u2019Koulou just a few months to become an essential component of the Cameroon squad. Born in Yaounde, N\u2019Koulou learned his trade with the highly regarded Kadji Sport Academy before beginning his rapid ascent to prominence with Monaco. The teenager did not spend long in the Ligue 1 club\u2019s youth teams, impressing in a couple of first-team friendlies en route to making his league debut at the age of 18 in September 2008. Over the course of that season he became an integral part of the side, thanks in no small part to his ability to slot in as both a holding midfielder and a central defender. After several outings for Cameroon\u2019s U-21 side, N\u2019Koulou earned selection for the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament Beijing 2008, the stepping stone to a place in the full national squad, where the then-coach Paul Le Guen used him primarily as a centre-half. He was a regular in the Indomitable Lions side the CAF Africa Cup of Nations in 2010 and, although only 20, he played in all three matches at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122.\\r\\nHis upward mobility with his clubs has been similarly speedy. After his league debut\\xa0at Monaco, he soon featured regularly for the side and not surprisingly, it did not take long before bigger clubs came calling. The 24-year-old joined\\xa0Marseille in 2011, and although he has been linked with more moves to Europe's biggest leagues, he has stayed at the Velodrome and gained UEFA Champions League experience. A good showing in Brazil, in what some have called Africa's best defence, would keep the youngster's stock moving even higher. "}, {"Cedric DJEUGOUE": "When Cameroon coach Volker Finke announced his initial 28-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 finals in mid-May, Cedric Djeugoue was shopping. The news that he was included in the list took the Coton Sport defender by surprise. \"A friend called me and I was very shocked. I had thought about it, of course. That pushed me to work harder.\" Like the other local-based player in the squad, goalkeeper Loic Feudjou, Djeugoue benefited from Coton Sports\\' impressive form in continental competitions. The defender scored a late equalizer against Angolan club Petro Atletico to take his side into the group phase of the CAF Confederations Cup. After being included in the initial squad, he admitted that he knew it would be difficult to make the final 23. \"All players will fight for their place. I just wanted to give my best so that I stood a chance.\" He was given his first chance against Macedonia as a second-half substitute and then started in the Indomitable Lions\\' 2-2 draw against Germany in the last friendly the team played before Finke announced the squad. The 21-year-old obviously impressed Finke to such an extent that he earned his place on the plane to Brazil."}, {"Dany NOUNKEU": "Although the versatile defender was first called up by Cameroon as an 18-year-old in 2004, Dany Nounkeu never fully established himself in the side until 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifying, when he played in six of their eight matches. Nounkeu first represented his country at youth level, when he competed with the team at the FIFA U-17 World Cup Finland 2003. He played in one of the all-time classic matches of the competition, when Cameroon came back from being 5-0 down against Portugal in the 52nd minute to draw 5-5. Having played the latter half of this season at Turkish giants Beskitas on loan from ambitious Galatasary, the 28-year-old started his career in France with Metz before joining CSO Ammeville. After spending two seasons in the lower leagues with Pau, he signed for Toulouse before moving to Turkey, where he joined Gaziantepspor on a three-year contract. His performances were so impressive that Galatasaray made an offer and he signed a four-year-contract with them. He scored a goal in the UEFA Champions League before being loaned out to Beskitas earlier this year.  "}, {"Henri BEDIMO": "Left-back Henri Bedimo was in the Montepellier side that stunned French football in 2012 when they won the league, and that win gave the 29-year-old a chance to play UEFA Champions League football. When the club failed to reach the same heights the following season, the Douala-born player, who moved to France when he was 15, sought a challenge, which he found with Lyon. He joined the club at the start of the 2013/14 season, and he soon established himself as a regular with the club as they won a spot in European football again next term. Bedimo was called up by the then-coach Paul Le Guen for the CAF Africa Cup of Nations 2010 as the only left-back in the\\xa0squad but he failed to make the trip to South Africa for the FIFA World Cup\u2122. Since then he has been on the periphery of the Indomitable Lions team, receiving several call-ups for the World Cup qualifying matches, and getting off the bench a total of four times.

"}, {"Aurelien CHEDJOU": "Defender Aurelien Chedjou\u2019s rise to prominence has come on the back of his displays at Ligue 1 outfit Lille, with whom he won the French title in 2011. Able to line up in central defence or as a defensive midfielder, Chedjou did not make his top-flight debut until the age of 22, but he has not looked back since. He moved to Spain as a teenager and joined the youth ranks of Villarreal, but wound up in France, where he has played for Pau, Axerre and Rouen before settling down with Lille, playing over 150 league games for them. In 2013, big-spending Turkish club Galatasaray made Lille an offer they could not refuse, and the 27-year-old joined up with Didier Drogba and Emmanuel Eboue. English Premier League clubs Newcastle United and Liverpool were also said to have been chasing Chedjou's signature before he decided to join the Turkish club. Chedjou represented his country at the Olympic Games in 2008, where the team advanced to the quarter-finals after beating Honduras and drawing with Korea Republic and Italy. In the quarter-finals they faced a star-studded Brazilian side, who won 2-0 after extra time. A year later Chedjou was called-up into the senior side and played in the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 qualifying campaign. Coach Paul Le Guen selected him for the Indomitable Lions squad for\\xa0the tournament\\xa0but the defender played just once \u2013 against the Netherlands when the Indomitable Lions had already been eliminated from the competition. He has since commanded a regular place in the team and played in all but one of\\xa0Cameroon's matches during qualifying for Brazil.

Nyom's club career has taken several unexpected paths. Born in Neuilly-sur Seine, he was a youth player with Nancy, before joining Arles-Avignon, who were then competing in the lower French leagues. Although he never played above the third tier of French football, he was signed by Serie A club Udinese in 2009 and signed a five-year deal with the club. Udinese in turn loaned him out to Spanish club Granada straight away. He soon became a regular for the Andalusian club and helped them gain promotion to the first division. Nyom has played more than 100 games in La Liga and in April was in the Granada side that secured the club's first victory against Barcelona since 1972. Last year he extended his contract with Udinese, even though he has yet to play for them.

Balanta started out as a forward but gradually dropped back before slotting in at the heart of the defence, where he has become a commanding presence, though he has also filled in at left-back on occasion. Left-footed, powerfully built, strong in the air and a fearless tackler, the young Balanta is also blessed with skill and speed and puts his long legs to good use in striding forward to attack whenever the opportunity arises.

Acosta did not make his international bow until the age of 28, a full seven years after he making his debut for Santos de Guapiles and one year after his move to Alajuelense. Nevertheless, the strong centre-back has made up for lost time, appearing in the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup and the 2011 Copa America. Acosta made seven appearances in FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying for Brazil, including scoring the first goal en route to  3-1 victory over USA in September 2013. That result helped Costa Rica finish second in CONCACAF qualifying, giving Acosta and Co some much deserved confidence heading into Brazil 2014. "}, {"Giancarlo GONZALEZ": "A defensive midfielder\\xa0who can also slot in at the back, Giancarlo Gonzalez's versatility makes him an important member of the Costa Rica squad. Standing at a lofty 6ft 3ins, Gonzalez began his professional career with Alajuelense in 2007 and was key to helping the club secure three titles.\\xa0 Gonzalez stepped on to the international stage in a supporting role for Costa Rica in a friendly against Peru in October 2010.\\xa0 His biggest moment in a  shirt to date came back in 2013 when he scored the lone goal of the UNCAF Copa Centroamericana final to seal a 1-0 win for Costa Rica over Honduras. In 2012, Gonzalez traversed the Atlantic to take up a key position in Valerenga\u2019s defense. In his time with the Norwegian side, Gonzalez played in 37 matches and scored 2 goals. In 2014, Gonzalez signed with Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer. He has already begun to stamp his authority as a no-nonsense defender in America\u2019s top-flight, which has only helped Gonzalez\u2019s confidence as he prepares to take on the likes of England, Italy and Uruguay at Brazil 2014. "}, {"Michael UMANA": "A veteran FIFA World Cup\u2122 participant and journeyman with an impressive 65 caps to his name, Michael Umana will feature in prominently in Costa Rica's defence at Brazil 2014. Umana offers coach Jorge Luis Pinto and fellow team-mates a calming influence, steady leadership and careful decision-making abilities - attributes only a footballer intimately familiar with the international stage could take on with his grace and poise.  During his time with Herediano, Umana represented Costa Rica at the Men's Olympic Football Tournament Greece 2004, where they lost to eventual winners Argentina in the quarter-finals. After a brief stint with LA Galaxy, Umana returned to Costa Rica to play for Brujas. Umana featured for  at Germany 2006 where they endured a searing 4-2 loss to the host country and subsequent defeats to Ecuador and Poland.\\xa0  After making an early exit from the World Cup, Umana returned back to Herediano and has since shifted between various clubs in the Americas, including another stint in MLS with Chivas USA. He now plays for Costa Rican club Saprissa where he has been since early 2013. Umana will look at Brazil 2014 to improve upon his past international performances and bring his wealth of knowledge and experience to an exciting and gritty side.  "}, {"Oscar DUARTE": "Born in Nicaragua, Costa Rica\u2019s neighbours to the north, Oscar Duarte began acclimating himself to the Costa Rican football scene in the Saprissa youth programme. After five years, 52 appearances and 2 goals for Saprissa at the professional level, Duarte joined Club Brugge of the Belgian Pro League in 2013.\\xa0 While he is still relatively untested on the international level, Duarte was a part of an experimental side at the 2011 UNCAF Copa Centroamerica where Costa Rica finished second, losing the final 2-1 to Honduras, though the centre-back failed to see any action. Then-coach Ricardo La Volpe said of the youngsters at the competition: \u201cThe experience that the young lads have picked up is incredibly important.\u201d Coach Jorge Luis Pinto will be hoping that experience gained back then, and in more recent call-ups - he has ten caps to his name to date - leads to a confident young Duarte who could be called upon at any point to help shut down opposing threats at Brazil 2014. "}, {"Dave MYRIE": "No biography available."}, {"Waylon FRANCIS": "Waylon Francis was largely overlooked by Jorge Luis Pinto during FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying, but a strong stretch of play in the early months of 2014, combined with Bryan Oviedo\u2019s untimely injury, has earned the left-back a ticket to Brazil 2014. Like many of his international team-mates, Francis started his career in the Saprissa youth set-up. However, he made his professional debut in the Primera Division for Brujas in 2001. After a brief stay at Limon, Francis moved to Herediano, where began to truly make a name for himself, particularly in the CONCACAF Champions League.\\xa0 His play caught the attention of several Major League Soccer sides, and in November 2013 Columbus Crew acquired Francis as a discovery player and he has since excelled for the Ohio-based outfit, starting in the club\u2019s first ten games of the 2014 campaign. His play in USA\u2019s top-flight impressed Pinto enough to make his 23-man squad for the World Cup, despite having only featured for  during the 2013 Copa Centroamericana, which was hosted and won by Pinto\u2019s side. If his recent performances are any indication of what can be expected of the 23-year old in the future, Francis is certainly shaping up to be a bright prospect of Costa Rica\u2019s backline. And while he may not feature prominently for Pinto at Brazil 2014, the experience gained at football\u2019s biggest stage will only help the young defender in future international match-ups. "}, {"Junior DIAZ": "Junior Diaz, the 30-year old native of Costa Rica\u2019s capital, San Jose, comes to the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 with several years of international experience under his belt and will bring added grit and determination to coach Jorge Luis Pinto\u2019s backline.  Diaz earned his first cap nearly 11 years ago in a friendly against China PR in September 2003 and has since made regular appearances with the Costa Rican national team, filling in admirably as either a fullback or box-to-box midfielder.\\xa0 Outside of international appearances, Diaz has led a varied international career. After four years and ten goals for Herediano, the already experienced defender joined Polish side Wisla Krakow in 2007, a team he returned to on loan after his transfer to Club Brugge in Belgium. After two years with the Belgians, Diaz moved east to Mainz in Germany in 2012. After a disappointingly missing out on South Africa 2010, dropping the intercontinental play-off to Urugay, Diaz will surely be looking to show his mettle at football\u2019s greatest stage. Whether Pinto plans to play Diaz in the midfield or in a more likely defensive posture remains to be seen, but his speed, agility and solid first touch will be very useful anywhere in the Costa Rican side. "}, {"Cristian GAMBOA": "Cristian Gamboa is a strong, versatile player who has featured both at right-back and in the midfield for clubs both in his native Costa Rica and overseas.\\xa0Gamboa began his professional career with Municipal Liberia and during his short stay he helped the team win the 2009 Clausura. Gamboa then joined Fredrickstad FK in Norway in the summer of 2010, appearing 27 times and scoring one goal in the process. A year later, the young midfielder transferred to Danish Superliga side FC Copenhagen, where he joined up with compatriot Brian Oviedo. Together they helped the club clinch the Danish Cup in 2011. Gamboa returned rather quickly to Norway in 2012, however, this time taking up a spot with Rosenborg. Despite success at the club level, Gamboa faced a difficult time breaking into the Costa Rican first team, even after putting in several solid shifts for  at the FIFA U-20 World Cup Egypt 2009. His first cap with the senior side came in January 2010 against Argentina. Since then, Gamoba has appeared in 12 total 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifiers, ten of which came in the final CONCACAF . "}, {"Roy MILLER": "A lanky defender, Roy Miller has been shoring up backlines for numerous overseas sides since his 2005 transfer from Cartagines. Regardless of where he plays his club football, he has been a constant presence in the national team picture since the days of his youth. Unsurprisingly, he now holds one of 23 coveted places on Jorge Luis Pinto\u2019s squad at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 and will undoubtedly be a frequently used asset to the team. After a rocky start to his professional career, Miller joined Norway\u2019s Bodo. He had a successful stay with the Norwegian club and provided six goals over the course of 52 appearances, and consistently impressive performances earned him increased interest from other Nordic teams. In 2008, Miller signed a three-year long contract with the Norwegian side Rosenborg. He rapidly asserted himself as the teams\u2019 leading left back, but his rise was cut short by a knee injury, followed by a successful and well received loan to Orgryte.  In 2010, Miller crossed the Atlantic to join his North American neighbours, the New York Red Bulls. In a well-timed turn of events, Miller\u2019s MLS debut was a 3-1 victory over Santos in the very first game to be played in the then-brand new Red Bull Arena. Miller continued his contract with the Red Bulls in 2013 and remains consistently in the starting XI for the MLS Eastern Conference squad today. Miller featured for  at the FIFA U-17 World Cup Trinidad and Tobago 2001 alongside current team-mate Carlos Johnson and helped Costa Rica qualify for Germany 2006, though he was unlucky not to be named to that tournament\u2019s final squad. He would continue to feature during the doomed-South Africa 2010 qualification and, most recently, throughout Costa Rica\u2019s successful Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign. "}, {"Sime VRSALJKO": "Sime Vrsaljko is one of generation of up-and-coming Croatian football stars. At the tender of age of just 22, he already appears to be a fixture in the  defence for years to come, chiefly because of his biggest asset: versatility. In what is a huge plus for any coach,\\xa0Vrsaljko is capable of turning out in either of the full-back positions. Like compatriot and superstar Luka Modric, Vrsaljko grew up in Zadar, but it is not just their shared roots that have led to comparisons between the two. Like Modric, Vrsaljko also played for Dinamo Zagreb, during which time he developed into a player of refined technical ability. After winning seven trophies in four years with the nation\u2019s record title-winners, he transferred to Italian side Genoa in 2013. Having represented his country from U-17 to U-21 level, Vrsaljko made his senior debut in February 2011 under Slaven Bilic and was part of the squad that qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, although he only made one appearance. This summer\u2019s finals will be his second major tournament after UEFA EURO 2012, where he was an unused substitute in all three of Croatia\u2019s group games. "}, {"Danijel PRANJIC": "Daniel Pranjic has enjoyed varied fortunes when it comes to the national team in recent seasons. His international career began brightly: he made his senior debut in November 2004 and then became a familiar face the in the squad, participating at both the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122 in Germany and UEFA EURO 2008. However, after publicly criticising the national team\u2019s sporting set-up in 2011, he was banned from the squad by then coach Slaven Bilic. He was recalled by Bilic\u2019s successor Igor Stimac but only featured fleetingly in the early days of Stimac\u2019s tenure, and did not play a single minute of his country\u2019s qualification campaign for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil. That period out in the cold was then ended when new coach Niko Kovac brought him back into the first-team fold for the World Cup play-off against Iceland in November 2013. Pranjic soon repaid his coach\u2019s trust, helping the 1998 FIFA World Cup semi-finalists book their ticket for Brazil. At club level Pranjic\u2019s most notable successes have come with Bayern Munich, with whom he reached two UEFA Champions League finals and won the league title. Previously he had helped Dutch top-tier outfit SC Heerenveen win their domestic cup, before leaving for Germany in 2009, even financing part of the transfer himself. He has also represented Dinamo Zagreb, Sporting Lisbon and Panathinaikos, making him one of Croatia\u2019s most experienced players. Pranjic is able to play on the left side of both attack and defence, as well as in central midfield. "}, {"Vedran CORLUKA": "Alongside Josip Simunic, Vedran Corluka was a crucial part of an uncompromising Croatian backline during 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifying. Given that the former will be suspended at the tournament, the weight of defensive responsibility will fall squarely on Corluka\u2019s shoulders. The 28-year-old, who can play both in the centre and on the right side of defence, has earned over 70 caps since making his senior debut in 2006, after previously representing his country at various youth levels. Corluka is one of the side\u2019s more seasoned players and gained major international tournament experience at the last two European Championships. The imposing defender left Dinamo Zagreb aged 21 after English Premier League side Manchester City secured his signature. Following subsequent transfers to Tottenham Hotspur and Bayer Leverkusen, Corluka ended up at Lokomotiv Moscow in 2012, having been recruited by Slaven Bilic, his coach with Croatia between 2006 and 2012. "}, {"Dejan LOVREN": "Dejan Lovren is without a doubt a future regular in the heart of the Croatian defence. In recent years, he has often had to play second fiddle to more established members of the national team, such as Josip Simunic and Vedran Corluka. Simunic\u2019s lengthy ban could provide an opportunity for Lovren to break into the starting line-up. He made seven appearances during Croatia\u2019s World Cup qualifying campaign and has appeared for every youth side from the U-17s onwards, receiving his first call-up to the full national team at the age of just 19. Olympique Lyon became aware of his talents in 2010 and soon brought him to France from Dinamo Zagreb. After three successful seasons at Lyon, he joined English Premier League outfit Southampton. Lovren was born in 1989 in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina (formerly of Yugoslavia). The outbreak of civil war forced his family to flee to Munich, but they soon returned and it was not long before they settled in Karlovac near Zagreb, where Dejan was raised. "}, {"Darijo SRNA": "It is fair to say Darijo Srna is a football idol in Croatia. With over 100 international caps, he has worn the captain\u2019s armband for almost six years after taking over from current national team boss Niko Kovac after the Blazers\u2019 UEFA EURO 2008 quarter-final exit against Turkey. Kovac will no doubt be counting on his former team-mate\u2019s vast experience, which encompasses the 2004, 2008 and 2012 EUROs, as well as the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122, in Brazil this summer. The defender enjoys similar standing in his adopted homeland of Ukraine. Since 2003 the 32-year-old has plied his trade for Shakhtar Donetsk, captaining the side to a string of national titles, as well as the 2009 UEFA Cup \u2013 the highlight of his club career to date. Previously he spent four years with Hajduk Split in his homeland. Srna is also a free-kick specialist and takes responsibility for set-pieces at both club and international level. He is also renowned for his tenacious playing style, as former national coach Slaven Bilic explained: \u201cKicking him won\u2019t stop him. Even if he\u2019s lying on the floor in pain, he\u2019s up on his feet again before you know it \u2013 almost like Robocop.\u201d "}, {"Gordon SCHILDENFELD": "Having represented as many as nine clubs in six countries by the age of 29, Gordon Schildenfeld is certainly something of a footballing globetrotter. Starting out at his hometown outfit Sibenik, he moved to Dinamo Zagreb in 2007. Then came stints in Turkey (Besiktas), Germany (Duisburg and later Eintracht Frankfurt), Austria (Sturm Graz), Russia (Dinamo Moscow) and finally Greece, where he now plays for Panathinaikos, having also spent time on loan at PAOK Salonika. As well as his vast experience, he has also picked up league-winner's medals in both Austria and Croatia. He made his debut for the national team in 2009 and three years later at UEFA EURO 2012 received his first taste of football at a major tournament, playing in all three of his country\u2019s group games. The tough-tackling defender spent much of Croatia\u2019s campaign to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 waiting in the wings behind first-choice defensive pairing Josip Simunic and Vedran Corluka, making just four appearances. However, he can look forward to playing a bigger part in Brazil this summer after Simunic was ruled out of the tournament through suspension. "}, {"Domagoj VIDA": "Domagoj Vida may be second choice behind influential captain and right-back Darijo Srna in the Croatia national team, but the defender has accepted his role as a reliable backup. Duly his appearances in qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 were limited to six and he was left out of the squad for the play-off tie with Iceland altogether, but the 25-year-old, who can also slot in at centre-back, will travel to Brazil as a versatile alternative should head coach Niko Kovac decide to move Srna into midfield. Born in Osijek, Vida attracted the attentions of numerous European clubs with his performances for hometown club NK Osijek. After spells at Bayer Leverkusen (Germany) and Dinamo Zagreb, he joined Ukrainian record titleholders Dynamo Kiev in summer 2013, where he has developed into a first-team regular.

A solid defender with a strong physique and great ability in the air, Guagua has had a somewhat nomadic career since making the breakthrough at Naval. After cementing his reputation at El Nacional, where he won two league titles, the then youngster sought out pastures new at Argentinian outfit Colon. Notwithstanding a season in Mexico with Atlante, he has spent the last seven years back in Ecuador with five different clubs: Emelec, Barcelona, Deportivo Quito, El Nacional again and most notably Liga de Quito, with whom he won another domestic championship and the 2010 Recopa Sudamericana. Guagua featured in the 2001 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Argentina, shortly after making his first senior international appearance in a qualifier for Japan/Korea 2002. He also featured in qualifying for Germany 2006, South Africa 2010 and Brazil 2014 and has been a member of three Copa America squads (2001, 2004 and 2007). With over 50 caps under his belt, including three in the World Cup finals, the seasoned stopper is a steady presence in the heart of the Ecuador defence. "}, {"Frickson ERAZO": "Cultured centre-half Frickson Erazo is one of the first names on the Ecuador team sheet. Though his lofty frame and athleticism make him powerful in the air, it is his ability to bring the ball out from the back that sets him apart \u2013 hence his nickname, . Despite his relatively young age, the 26-year-old Esmeraldas native has amassed a wealth of experience. He won the Ecuadorian title as a youngster at El Nacional, where he spent the early years of his career, a short-lived loan spell at Tecnico Universitario aside. After being snapped up by Guayaquil side Barcelona, his consistent performances helped him clinch another league title and then a move to Brazilian giants Flamengo at the beginning of 2014. Since making his senior international debut in a 2011 Copa America warm-up fixture against Argentina in Mar del Plata (he would go on to feature in the tournament proper), Erazo has become a virtual ever-present at the heart of the Ecuador defence. Indeed, he clocked up 1,297 minutes of action on the road to Brazil, playing in all but one of the 16 qualifiers. "}, {"Juan PAREDES": "Juan Carlos Paredes is a marauding full-back combining bags of pace, plenty of trickery and direct running on the overlap, attributes that\\xa0naturally caught the eye of Ecuador coach Reinaldo Rueda. Esmeraldas-born Paredes, 26, came up through the ranks at local club Huracan, but a big switch to Guayaquil giants Barcelona soon beckoned. He was on the move again before too long, though, briefly playing for Deportivo Cuenca and then dropping down the divisions to help third-tier Rocafuerte gain promotion to Serie B. Following another stint at Deportivo Cuenca, where he finished second in the league, the full-back won his first top-flight title at Deportivo Quito in 2011 before\\xa0going full circle\\xa0by rejoining Barcelona last year. Paredes earned his senior Ecuador debut\\xa0in a 2010 friendly against Mexico and subsequently shrugged off the disappointment of missing the 2011 Copa America to establish himself as\\xa0a key performer for his country, featuring in 14 of 16 qualifiers on the road to the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122.

Bagui played youth football in Argentina and only made the move back to Ecuador in 2003, to sign professional terms with Olmedo. His performances there led to a switch to Guayaquil side Barcelona, where he spent two years before signing for Quito outfit Universidad Catolica. He is currently on the books of Emelec, where he is one of the first names on the team sheet and tasted title glory in 2013. Almost a decade has been and gone since the 31-year-old full-back won his first international cap back in 2005. Having been involved in the 2007 Copa America, he played in three 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122\\xa0qualifiers that same year, only to gradually fall out of favour. Several\\xa0years in the international wilderness followed before Reinaldo Rueda recalled Bagui for a couple of friendlies in 2013.

As such, he regularly picks forwards' pockets and brings the ball out with aplomb. Gabo, as he is nicknamed, began his career at Oro before going on to make his professional debut at Deportivo Cuenca. He got his first taste of top-flight football after gaining promotion with Liga de Loja and later joined Deportivo Azogues and then Emelec, where he has cemented his burgeoning reputation and lifted the domestic title. Achilier's international career dates back to 2005, when he was a member of the U-20 squad that took part in the South American Youth Championship in Colombia. Having graduated to the senior ranks in 2008, for a friendly against Haiti, he went on to feature at the 2011 Copa America in Argentina on the back of some impressive form at club level.

Johnson started with West Ham United but had spent seven weeks on loan at Millwall before making his Premier League bow for the Hammers at 18.  After making 15 appearances in that debut season, he moved across London to Chelsea and won the Premier League title and the League Cup with them in 2005. He spent most of 2006/07 on loan at Portsmouth and signed for the south coast club permanently at the start of the following season, winning the FA Cup with them in 2008.  His move to Liverpool came a year later and he has been a regular at Anfield ever since, winning the League Cup in 2012 and helping his team to the FA Cup Final in the same year.  Johnson won his first England caps with the U-15s, made 14 appearances for the Under-21s and was given his senior debut as a substitute for Gary Neville in a friendly against Denmark at Old Trafford on 16 November 2003 while still a teenager.  He established himself in the senior side in the second half of 2008/09, starting six consecutive games and providing a hat-trick of \u2018assists\u2019 against Andorra at Wembley. The Londoner was first-choice during England's 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 campaign and scored his first England goal in a friendly against Mexico that year.

He also played in all four matches at the 2007 UEFA Under-21 Championship Finals in the Netherlands as his caps total for the U-21s reached 16.  He became established in Everton\u2019s first team in the 2008/09 season, featuring in 31 Premier League matches, and forced his way into the England squad for the first time for the Wembley internationals against Slovakia and Ukraine in the European spring. But he had to wait until March 2010 for his senior debut, Fabio Capello including him in the team that started the Wembley friendly with Egypt.  Leighton has played in two major finals; for Wigan in the 2006 Football League Cup and for Everton in the 2009 FA Cup.

His other caps came in the same season: a 5-0 win over Slovakia in a friendly and a 0-0 draw with Czech Republic in the opening fixture of the UEFA Championship Finals in the Netherlands.  At the age of 23, and while playing for Bolton Wanderers, Cahill was chosen for his first full England squad following the injured Rio Ferdinand\u2019s withdrawal from the squad to travel to Kazakhstan for a FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifier in June 2009.  He missed out on a place in the final squad for South Africa, but was given the chance to impress in a UEFA EURO 2012 qualifier at home to Bulgaria and friendlies against Denmark and Ghana. Cahill then scored his first England goal in the 3-0 victory away to Bulgaria in September 2011.  The 28-year-old joined Chelsea in January 2012 and enjoyed instant success as he helped his new club to both the FA Cup and UEFA Champions League Finals.

He was originally placed on the standby list for England's UEFA EURO 2012 squad and played the full match in a pre-tournament warm-up game against Norway, which England won 1\u20130. However, Jagielka was subsequently added to the main squad after Gareth Barry was ruled out of the tournament with an abdominal injury. He did not feature in any of England's four matches during the tournament.  In August 2012, Jagielka scored his first goal for England, a diving header during a 2\u20131 friendly victory over Italy in Bern, Switzerland. Since then he has established himself as a regular for England and kept up his high standards in the Premier League.  The 31-year-old is also known for his versatility.

The following season he helped the Cottagers to the final of the UEFA Europa League and attracted the attentions of Manchester United who signed him in the summer of 2010. At Old Trafford, he has won two Premier League titles and three FA Community Shields. Although primarily a central defender, he can also play as a right-back.  Smalling has represented England at various levels and is currently a member of the England senior squad.

He has also been on the international radar. Some impressive performances for Blackburn Rovers academy and reserves led to Jones receiving his first international call-up for the England U-19s game with Turkey at Scunthorpe in late 2009, when he made his debut from the substitutes' bench.  It was not long after that when he was promoted into the Ewood Park senior squad and handed a Premier League debut as his development hastened in 2010 under then manager Sam Allardyce.  Jones was back in the U-19s squad for the Elite Round Qualification in May 2010, when he played a key role in helping the Young Lions to qualify for the European Championship Finals in France. In August 2010 he made his first appearance for Stuart Pearce's U-21s side, helping them reach the 2011 UEFA Under-21s Championship Finals in Denmark.  Before heading out to the tournament he put pen to paper on a deal to move from Ewood Park to Old Trafford; and some impressive performances at Old Trafford where he won the Premier League title have since seen him called up to the senior squad.  He made his England debut against Montenegro in October 2011 and is tipped by some as a future captain of the Three Lions.\\xa0\\xa0 "}, {"Luke SHAW": "A highly-rated and impressive defender, Luke has been a regular with England since he was 15 after making his Three Lions debut for the U-16s in 2011.   Born in Surrey, the left-back is a product of the famous Southampton youth academy and was in the Saints' first-team by the age of 18.   Extremely mobile and comfortable on the ball, Shaw is equally adept in defensive positions as he is in supporting the attack and he quickly made a good impression on the Premier League following his introduction in 2012.   Luke's England career started when he featured six times for the England U-16s in the 2010/11 campaign and he grabbed the opening goal against Uruguay in the Montaigu Tournament in April 2011.   Further caps came at U-17 level, before he was called up to the U-21 squad in 2012 and has since been a regular fixture in the team when fully fit. On 27 February this year, Shaw was called up to the England senior side for the first time, for their friendly with Denmark. He made his debut in the game, replacing Ashley Cole at half-time.  "}, {"Raul ALBIOL": "\\r\\nGroomed at Valencia, the centre-back was involved in a serious road accident on his way to sign for Getafe in 2004, shortly after lifting the UEFA U-19 Championship trophy with Spain. It proved to be a major turning point in his life.\\xa0\\r\\n He returned to Valencia after a spell with the Madrid-based side, but was soon on his way back to the Spanish capital when came calling in 2009. He accepted his position in the bench with no complaints as he was still in the plans of the national coach, though also in the bench. In 2013, he signed with Napoli and now, finally, he has a more prominent position in the club.  Standing at 1.87 m, Albiol\u2019s aerial ability is one of his main assets, although his positioning, unflinching tackling and distribution from the back are equally effective. Albiol has been a regular in  squads ever since making his international debut in October 2007. He has formed part of the historic achievements of a uniquely successful crop of players, winning the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 as well as successive UEFA EUROs in 2008 and 2012. "}, {"Gerard PIQUE": "With Carles Puyol out injured, Gerard Pique has taken on extra responsibility, assuming the role of defensive leader for both Barcelona and the Spanish national team. Strong, intelligent and technically gifted, Pique has, over the years, earned the nickname  in honour of legendary German sweeper  Franz Beckenbauer. His powerful physique and strong aerial ability means he is both a commanding defensive presence and a real threat in the opposition's penalty area. And while clearly a danger from set-pieces, Pique is also known for his ability to bring the ball out of defence and use his skill and vision to join attacks. After spending most of his youth career at Barcelona, Pique moved to England at 17 and joined Manchester United,\\xa0gaining his first taste of European football. He then spent 2006/07 on loan at Real Zaragoza, before returning to his native Catalonia to rejoin . In his maiden season he won every club honour available, and also earned his first senior cap for Spain. Pique has represented Spain at all levels, and was part of the side that won the UEFA European U-19 Championship in 2006. Vicente del Bosque gave him his first senior outing for  in\\xa0February 2009. Since then he has become a cornerstone of the Spanish defence, having helped  win both the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the UEFA EURO 2012. "}, {"JUANFRAN": "After climbing up through the ranks at Real Madrid and then failing to break into the first team, Juanfran decided to move in on 2005, spending a season with Espanyol, with whom he won the Copa del Rey in 2006. The full-back then enjoyed five years with Osasuna before returning to the Spanish capital to pull on the red and white jersey of Atletico Madrid, where sustained success has come his way. \\r\\nThough originally signed to replace Simao on the right side of attack, Juanfran was forced by circumstances to switch to a more defensive role, eventually cementing his place in the side at right-back. Quick, watchful and incisive whenever he pushes forward, he is ideally suited to the position. \\r\\nHe also had a distinguished youth career with Spain, forming part of the sides that won the UEFA European Under-19 Championship in 2004 and appeared at the FIFA U-20 World Cups in the UAE in 2003 (where  finished runners-up) and in the Netherlands in 2005. He eventually won his first full international cap in May 2012 and was a non-playing member of the squad that retained Spain\u2019s UEFA EURO crown in Ukraine and Poland that year. "}, {"Sergio RAMOS": "A product of Sevilla's youth system, Sergio Ramos made his top-flight debut at the age of only 17. In 2005 he joined Real Madrid and has since cemented a reputation as one of the most reliable defenders in world football. Ramos made his name as an attacking right-back but has more recently been deployed in central defence, where he has excelled over the past season. His powerful physique and heading ability makes him a real threat in the air, particularly at set-pieces, from which he has scored an impressive number of goals down the years. A true Andalusian, with a passion for bullfighting and flamenco, Ramos was the youngest European football player to reach 100 caps for his national team (in March 2013). He made his debut with  in 2005 as a 19-year-old. He made his first appearance in a major tournament at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany\u2122 and has featured for Spain at every competition since, winning back-to-back UEFA EUROs and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. "}, {"Jordi ALBA": "The left-back position in the Spanish national side has caused headaches for successive coaches, but a solution\\xa0has been found in Jordi Alba. \\r\\nAfter coming through Barcelona\u2019s youth system as a left-sided attacking midfielder, Alba departed the club aged 16 to join provincial side UE Cornella. A move to Valencia followed a year later, where he fine-tuned his famed body swerves, speed and lung-busting bursts forward. Upon reaching the first team, coach Unay Emery converted Alba into a left-back, a move which has paid rich dividends.\\r\\n Vicente del Bosque handed him a debut appearance for in October 2011 and Alba was included in Spain\u2019s UEFA EURO 2012 squad after just eight international outings. He swiftly made the left-back position his own and was a key member of the title-winning side, crowning an outstanding tournament with a goal in the final against Italy. That was enough to persuade Barcelona to bring Alba home, where he is developing into a left-back in the classical Brazilian style: an attack-minded defender who gets forward at every opportunity. The only blot on his copy book came at the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament at London 2012, as Spain fell at the first hurdle and returned home after the group stage. "}, {"Mathieu DEBUCHY": "Right-back Mathieu Debuchy spent the first ten seasons of his career at Lille, where he won plaudits for his contributions further up the pitch and his dedication to the cause. \"He\\'s a player who puts his head where others wouldn\\'t put their feet,\" noted his one-time Lille coach Claude Puel, and Debuchy\\'s efforts were certainly key as raised their standing on the domestic scene and graced the European game. Above all, his loyalty was rewarded in 2011, when he won a league and cup double with the club alongside the likes of Yohan Cabaye, Eden Hazard and Gervinho.Debuchy received his maiden France call-up the same year, following an injury to Bakari Sagna. It was fair recognition for a player who had developed into one of the best right-backs in Ligue 1, underlining the exciting new level he was reaching. He contested the qualifying campaign ahead of UEFA EURO 2012 and then appeared in the finals as a first-choice starter, and he has continued to be a reliable performer on France\\'s right flank since Didier Deschamps took the reins. He also enjoys a starting berth for Newcastle United, having left Lille for the Premier League in January last year. "}, {"Patrice EVRA": "Patrice Evra boasts the relentless energy of a dynamo. Watch the Manchester United and France full-back in action and what stands out is the sheer distance he covers down the left, both frustrating opposition attacks and lending a hand during his own team's forays forward. Since his days as a youth player in and around Paris, Evra has forged the mentality of a warrior and racked up an impressive level of experience, having first moved abroad to join third-tier Italian side Marsala aged just 17. Quickly spotted by Monza, he climbed up a division, only to return to France a season later to sign for Nice. \\xa0\\r\\nIt was with Nice's local rivals Monaco that Evra really began turning heads, however, playing a full part as the principality side finished runners-up in the UEFA Champions League under Didier Deschamps in 2003/04. From there, the defender set sail for Manchester, since when he has amassed a formidable list of honours, including wins in the Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup. Voted best left-back in the Premier League in 2007, 2009 and 2010, he was likewise singled out as the top player in his position in the 2009 FIFA/FIFPro World XI.\\r\\nFor France, his opportunities were initially limited by Eric Abidal, yet Evra finally made the left-back spot his own after the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122. UEFA EURO 2008 proved a low point, but worse was to come at South Africa 2010, where Evra captained a side that disappointed supporters both on and off the pitch. Eager to shine on African soil, the native of Dakar, Senegal, was left heartbroken by that experience. He also served an extended period out of the team through suspension, but has forced his way back in thanks to his consistent displays for the Red Devils. "}, {"Raphael VARANE": "Raphael Varane is one of the most promising defenders in the game today, having already shown himself to be a dependable servant for both Real Madrid and France. Sharp and impressively effective for his age, the centre-back began his professional career\\xa0at 17 with Lens, and he showed sufficient potential in his first season for to make their move. A period of adaptation followed, but, despite his tender years, the youngster was soon allowed to prove he had the quality to prosper at the Santiago Bernabeu. He was also named in Didier Deschamps's first France squad in August 2012, after serving the U-21 side with distinction.\\r\\nVarane was rewarded with first-team status in his second season at Madrid and continued to string together top-drawer performances, not least his showing against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey. Called up again by , this time he collected his maiden cap in a 1-0 victory against Georgia in 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying. Varane's ascent had been undeniably thrilling, yet it was impeded by a knee injury towards the end of the campaign which kept him sidelined for several months. Shortly after his return, he was called back up by Deschamps and started the 3-0 second-leg win against play-off rivals Ukraine that stamped France's ticket to Brazil. "}, {"Mamadou SAKHO": "Scorer of two goals as France downed Ukraine 3-0 in their play-off decider, Mamadou Sakho was the central hero of the team's qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122. It was an unforgettable moment for the athletic centre-back, who first rose through Paris Saint-Germain's academy system to make his professional debut at 17. Just a few months after his introduction to Ligue 1, the left-footed defender then became the youngest player in the club's history to slip on the captain's armband.\\r\\nA precocious talent, Sakho's potential was spotted early on by his country as well, and he represented France at every age group in his youth. That brought him vital experience in a number of international tournaments, and when he eventually made his first senior appearance, he could pride himself on being the third youngest centre-back to ever line up for .\\r\\nParticularly effective in the tackle, Sakho was also beginning to stand out as a linchpin for a PSG side in transition. His progress was nonetheless interrupted by the club's ambitious transfer policy, with a fresh injection of resources paving the way for the recruitment of established names such as Brazilian duo Alex and Thiago Silva. Frustrated by his lack of playing time, Sakho finally opted to leave the French capital for Liverpool in September 2013. "}, {"Eliaquim MANGALA": "Central defender Eliaquim Mangala has pursued a somewhat unusual career path, never having played in France, except for when wearing the blue jersey of the French national team. Born in Paris, Mangala moved to Belgium at the age of 5. He started playing professional football with CS W\u00e9pionnais, before moving on to UR Namur, where he was spotted by a scout from Standard Liege.\\xa0 Mangala made his debut for the Belgian giants in 2008 aged only 17 and it was here, alongside a generation of superstars including Axel Witsel and Steven Defour that he kicked off his career in style by winning both the domestic league and the Belgian Supercup, and, two years later, adding the Belgian Cup to the list. It was during this 2010-2011 season that he caught the attention of FC Porto, and at the end of it the Portuguese club killed two birds with one stone, signing Defour along with the Frenchman. After a season settling in, Mangala took advantage of the Brazilian Maicon\u2019s injury to establish himself in Porto\u2019s defence. He is a powerful footballer, always in the right place, good with his head and on the counter, as well as being a threat in the opposition box from dead-ball situations. After bagging his second consecutive championship title in Portugal, Mangala was called up by Didier Deschamps for the first time in June 2013. He had to wait until March this year for a second appearance, playing alongside Raphael Varane in a match against the Netherlands in which he successfully marked Robin van Persie out of the game. "}, {"Bacary SAGNA": "Born in Sens, Bakari Sagna joined nearby outfit Auxerre at the age of 14, though he opted for a sports study programme and focused on obtaining his (A-Level equivalent) before entering the club's academy. Reputed for polishing various diamonds down the years, Auxerre gave Sagna the perfect environment to develop his skills at a steady pace, and at first he turned out for the reserves as a forward. Despite showing promise in front of goal, he was asked one day to fill in at right-back and never left.\\r\\nSagna was introduced to Ligue 1 in 2004/05 and soon began to be regarded as one of the finest defenders in the French game, being named best right-back by his fellow players in 2006/07. Among his admirers was Raymond Domenech, who brought him into the France fold as a back-up to Willy Sagnol and then handed him a first start against Slovakia in August 2007. That same summer, Sagna earned a transfer to Arsenal, where his energy and crossing acumen swiftly helped him shine. He has used those same qualities to good effect with  as well, inheriting a first-team berth after Sagnol's retirement following UEFA EURO 2008 \u2013 although he now faces stiff competition from Mathieu Debuchy. "}, {"Lucas DIGNE": "Never one to take his foot off the pedal, Lucas Digne spends the full 90 minutes of every game putting in maximum effort. \"When you play on the wing, you can\\'t allow yourself the slightest easing-off and you constantly have to work hard,\" the left-back told  during the FIFA U-20 World Cup Turkey 2013, which ended with France lifting the trophy. \"My first priority is to defend well, but I also have to do everything I can to help out offensively. That\\'s the job of a modern full-back. The coach gives you instructions, but there\\'s also an element of intuition, knowing when you can get forward and when to hold back so as not to unbalance the team.\"\\r\\nDigne first began learning the nuances of his role with Lille, where he made his Ligue 1 debut in 2011 before signing for Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2013. Despite stiff competition from Maxwell at the Parc des Princes, the youngster \u2013 who will turn 21 in July \u2013 earned promotion to the France side in February this year, when he came on for Patrice Evra against the Netherlands. A fan of Philipp Lahm, he derives much of his ambition to succeed from the example of his older brother, a former Lille youth academy member who had to quit the game after injury. \"He had a lot of quality, but he got injured and couldn\\'t regain his previous level and never got the chance to break into the professional squad,\" said Digne. \"I know that he\\'s now living his dream through me, and that gives me the strength to never admit defeat.\" "}, {"Laurent KOSCIELNY": "Quick and constantly alert, Laurent Koscielny is a mobile centre-back who also likes to get forward, especially at set pieces. At club level, his myriad qualities helped him climb the French domestic ladder one rung at a time, but he made a giant leap in 2010 when he swapped Lorient for Arsenal after just a single season in Ligue 1. \\r\\nThe move always looked a shrewd one to Arsene Wenger, a French football connoisseur, and the Gunners' manager was quickly proved right as Koscielny settled into his new surroundings with aplomb, forging a reputation as one of the best defenders in the Premier League. A maiden France call-up then followed a year after the move, and Koscielny won his first cap in a 1-0 success against USA on 11 November 2011.\\r\\nSince then, the Arsenal stopper has attempted to lock down a starting berth. Initially left on the sidelines as Laurent Blanc preferred to pair Philippe Mexes and Adil Rami in the middle, Koscielny now faces competition from the likes of Raphael Varane and Mamadou Sakho, who performed impeccably together in the 3-0 second-leg victory against play-off rivals Ukraine that sealed France's place at Brazil 2014. "}, {"Kevin GROSSKREUTZ": "In terms of sheer versatility, Kevin Grosskreutz is in a class of his own in the German national team. The Borussia Dortmund all-rounder is comfortable both in defensive and attacking roles on either flank and can also be deployed as a holding midfielder. That adaptability and his tireless running have earned Grosskreutz a reputation as an invaluable squad member for both club and country.\\r\\nHe has long been a fan favourite as much for his never-say-die attitude on the pitch as for his down-to-earth demeanour away from it, while his passion and emotion are both refreshing and inspiring. \\r\\nAs a 19-year-old the Dortmund native was influential in helping Rot-Weiss Ahlen earn promotion to Bundesliga 2, standing out for his clinical finishing in front of goal. In 2009 Grosskreutz joined his boyhood club Dortmund, for whom he played several games at junior level, and swiftly became a first-team regular while at the same time coaching a youth side in the Dortmund district of Eving.\\r\\nIn subsequent years at Dortmund Grosskreutz won the league title twice and the DFB Cup once, as well as playing in the final of the UEFA Champions League. National team coach Joachim Low will be counting on his energy and ball-winning abilities to help Germany to success at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122. "}, {"Matthias GINTER": "It was clear from an early age that Matthias Ginter was a footballer of outstanding talent. Along with Mario Gotze, he is the only man to twice win the prestigious gold Fritz-Walter Medal for the best player in his national team age group (the U-18s in 2012 and the U-19s in 2013), and is one of the future stars of German football.\\r\\n Since the age of 11, Ginter has been on the books of SC Freiburg, a club famed for producing young talent. He spent much of his teen years playing in midfield, showing adeptness in both defending and attacking roles, but when he announced himself on the Bundesliga stage, it was as a central defender. Aged just 20, this model athlete, who is as strong and competitive in the air as he is on the deck, already boats 70 appearances for Freiburg and has regularly represented Germany at U-18, U-19 and U-21 level. On 5 March 2014 coach Joachim Low gave Ginter his senior international debut in 1-0 friendly win against Chile in Stuttgart, making him the 900th player to represent the German national side. "}, {"Benedikt HOEWEDES": "Benedikt Howedes, Schalke 04\u2019s captain is a true defensive all-rounder. He can play anywhere across the back four and is thus a highly useful player for Germany coach Joachim Low. Though most comfortable in central defence, for the senior Germany side he has made the majority of his appearances at right-back. Strong in the air at both ends of the pitch, his straightforward, uncompromising and reliable style is valued by both club and country. Howedes received his footballing education at the Schalke youth academy, an institute highly revered in Germany for its youth coaching. In 2007 he received the prestigious gold Fritz Walter Medal as the best player in Germany's U-19 squad, while he went on to win the UEFA European U-21 Championship in 2009. At club level in 2010/11, he helped Schalke to the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League prior to winning his first senior trophy, the German Cup, with victory over Duisburg. It was in the summer of 2011 that he celebrated making his senior international debut and 12 months later he was picked in Joachim Low\u2019s final 23-man squad for UEFA EURO 2012, although he did not play in Poland and Ukraine. Howedes did, however, make three appearances as Low\u2019s charges qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, and will hoping to debut at a major international tournament this summer. "}, {"Mats HUMMELS": "An ever-present at both club and international level, Mats Hummels has developed into one of Europe\u2019s finest centre-backs in recent years, his elegant playing style even drawing comparisons with the legendary Franz Beckenbauer. Borussia Dortmund\u2019s defensive stalwart is as strong in the tackle as he is in the air, possesses an outstanding ability to read the game, while his open and articulate manner makes him a natural leader off the pitch as well as on it. Hummels, who won the UEFA European U-21 Championship with Germany in 2009, joined Bayern Munich at just seven years of age, but failed to break into the first-team squad. He joined Dortmund at 19 \u2013 first on loan, then as a permanent signing. It was a move that paid off, as Hummels played a major role in the \u2019 league title victory in 2011, their league and DFB Cup double in 2012, as well as their route to the 2013 UEFA Champions League final.  His performances for the national team at UEFA EURO 2012 were no less impressive: Hummels became a regular for Joachim Low\u2019s side in Poland and Ukraine and, not only did he win the second-most tackles during the group stage, he did so without conceding a single foul. The defensive giant is now looking to add stability to Germany's defence at the 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 in Brazil. "}, {"Erik DURM": "Not even a year has passed since Erik Durm made his Bundesliga debut, yet now the Borussia Dortmund striker-turned-full-back is now one of the 23 names in the final Germany squad for the upcoming 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122. The 22-year-old is without doubt one of the biggest discoveries of the season. Thanks to his speed and tackling ability, as well as a remarkable understanding of the game, Durm has emerged as an attractive option for national team coach Joachim Low, available to fill in on either the right or left side of the back four. After transferring from 1. FC Saarbrucken to 1. FSV Mainz 05 at the age of 18, Durm impressed enough to be picked to represent his country at youth level, before signing for Dortmund in time for the 2012/13 season. He was restricted to appearing for the U-23 side in his first year at BVB, but when first-team left-back Marcel Schmelzer was ruled out with injury, Durm was presented with an opportunity to stake his claim in the senior side, and he has not looked back since.  Debuting away to FC Augsburg on the opening day of the 2013/14 campaign, Durm has gone on to make 19 Bundesliga appearances for Jurgen Klopp\u2019s team as well as seven in the UEFA Champions League, where he more than held his own against some of Europe\u2019s top wingers, such as Gareth Bale and Angel di Maria. Repeating those performances against the world\u2019s best in Brazil will be his biggest test yet, but Durm will no doubt be up for the challenge. "}, {"Per MERTESACKER": "Standing at around 6'6 tall, Per Mertesacker\u2019s stature is almost as imposing as his leadership qualities and international experience. Regarded as the rock in Germany\u2019s defence, Mertesacker\u2019s tackling and aerial strength have earned him a regular starting berth in Joachim Low\u2019s side, while his technical ability and build-up play have also come on leaps and bounds in recent years. The Hanover-born star had wanted to quit playing football as a youngster but, after experiencing a late surge, Mertesacker made his Bundesliga debut for Hannover 96 just after his 19th birthday. After only 20 league appearances, he received his first call-up to the national side. Before long, Mertesacker was a regular for Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s team, establishing himself as an international-class defender at the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122. He then moved to Werder Bremen, where he played a major role in the northern German side\u2019s DFB Cup win in 2009, as well as their run to the UEFA Cup final that same season. Known affectionately as \u2018\u2019 by fans, Mertesacker played the full 90 minutes on seven occasions at South Africa 2010, before completing a dream move to Arsenal \u2013 the club he\u2019d supported as a boy \u2013 a year later. Under the tutelage of Arsene Wenger, Mertesacker has become a leading figure in the Gunners\u2019 defence. Thanks to his positional play and tactical nous, the defensive stalwart doesn\u2019t commit many fouls and has received widespread praise for his fair approach. He has even donned the captain\u2019s armband in the absence of Philipp Lahm and Bastian Schweinsteiger. The honorary Londoner is now determined to make his 100th international appearance at the 2014 World Cup and improve on Germany\u2019s recent third-place finishes at football\u2019s showcase event. "}, {"Jerome BOATENG": "Off the pitch he comes across as quiet and reserved, but on it Jerome Boateng is an uncompromising warrior, feared by opposing forwards. The Berlin-born defender has become a key cog in the centre of not only the FC Bayern Munich defence but also that of the German national team, while he can also fill in at right-back.  Boasting an imposing physique, he is adept at using both feet, is good in the air and an excellent tackler. To these attributes he has also crucially improved his passing and ability to orchestrate attacks from the back. The son of a German mother and a Ghanaian father, Boateng\u2019s first club was Tennis Borussia Berlin - formerly a familiar name in German professional football - whom he joined at the age of ten, before his discovery by city powerhouses Hertha Berlin three years later. Boateng would go on to make his Bundesliga debut with the \u2018Old Lady\u2019 from the nation\u2019s capital as an 18-year-old, twice appearing alongside his half-brother Kevin-Prince Boateng, one and a half years his senior and who would later go on to play international football for Ghana. It was clear from an early stage that, like Kevin-Prince, Jerome was destined for greatness. In the summer of 2007, he moved to Hamburg and in 2010 to Manchester City. He struggled to command a starting spot in his favoured central role with the Citizens, however, and when Bayern came calling a year later, he duly accepted a return to Germany, where he has gone from strength to strength.\\xa0\\r\\n A winner of the UEFA European U-21 Championship with the national team in 2009, Boateng started five games for the senior Germany side at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122, making a major contribution as Joachim Low\u2019s side finished in third place. He also made seven appearances as the team qualified for Brazil 2014, finishing the campaign as one of their key players. A two-time winner of the Bundesliga with Bayern, in 2013 he also lifted the UEFA Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup trophies. Now the 25-year-old is looking to add an international title to his already long list of honours. "}, {"Shkodran MUSTAFI": "Shkodran Mustafi\u2019s World Cup call-up demonstrates that the route to the Germany squad does not necessarily need to pass through the Bundesliga. After all, the central defender managed to catch coach Joachim Low\u2019s eye despite never having played a game in the German top flight. Yet the 22-year-old has been a first team regular with Sampdoria in Italy for some time now, and before that played in England with Everton. The son of Albanian immigrants, Mustafi grew up in Germany and was discovered as a teenager playing in an indoor football tournament for the youth team of amateur club Rotenburg. From there he progressed through the Hamburg youth system, switching from striker to defender in the process. He was just 17 when Mustafi made the move to England to play for Everton. Strong and fiercely competitive, Mustafi has played for Germany at every level from U-16 through to U-21. In the 2009 UEFA European Under-17 Championship he played every minute of every game, and was one of the key players as Germany lifted the trophy. In the same year, the central defender played in the FIFA U-17 World Cup Nigeria. Four years later, he was part of the German team that took part in the UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Israel. Mustafi made his debut as a full German international in May 2014 in a goalless friendly in Hamburg against Poland. He was originally part of his country\u2019s 30-man provisional squad list, before missing out on a place in the final squad. After the injury that forced Marco Reus to miss the World Cup, however, Low decided to swap an attacking player for a defender, and called up Mustafi.

He was among the players who successfully converted a penalty in a shootout against Brazil in the final in Cairo, ensuring Ghana became the first African side to win the FIFA U-20 World Cup. His performances were such that he made the Black Stars squad for the FIFA World Cup\u2122 the following year, and he has been a regular in the squad ever since. Inkoom, who turns 25 at the start of June, hails from the coastal town of Sekondi, where he began his club career at Sekondi Hasaacas. His potential and athletic ability saw him move to Asante Kotoko at the start of 2008 after only just a few months with Sekondi. By the end of the year he\\'d won his first international cap in a friendly against Tunisia and, in 2009, Inkoom was on the move again. He headed to Switzerland, where he signed for FC Basel before moving, once more, to Ukrainian outfit Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. Two loan periods at French side Bastia and Greek outfit Platanias followed, with the defender eventually signing a permanent contract deal with the latter."}, {"Daniel OPARE": "Still just 23, Daniel Opare is a right-back known for making lightning-quick runs up the flank and delivering inch-perfect crosses. He first grabbed international headlines during the FIFA U-17 World Cup in\\xa02007, helping the Black Starlets to fourth place.

Chiellini has continued to shine in the domestic sphere as well, being voted by his peers as Serie A Defender of the Year three times in a row between 2008 and 2010. The primary outlet for Gianluigi Buffon, he is also the goalkeeper\u2019s natural replacement as captain, having first worn the armband for Italy against Switzerland on 14 November 2012. His gifts extend beyond the realm of football too, and he obtained a degree in Business and Economics at the University of Turin in 2010, earning a final mark of 109 out of 110. \\xa0 "}, {"Matteo DARMIAN": "Though naturally left-footed, full-back Matteo Darmian has a preference for the right flank, making him a versatile player to have around. Of Armenian extraction but born in the northern Italian town of Legnano, he played his youth football for AC Milan before making his first-team debut in a Coppa Italia match in November 2006.  A maiden Serie A appearance followed the very next season against Udinese, but like many other young Italian talents Darmian was forced to go on his travels in search of first-team football, spending time at Padova, Torino and Palermo but playing only 15 top-flight games up to 2012.\\r\\n His fortunes changed when Torino decided to sign him on a permanent deal. Earning a regular starting place as the 2012/13 season got under way, he established himself as one of the best full-backs in Serie A. A first choice also at every age level for Italy, Darmian caught the eye of Cesare Prandelli during another fine season with the Turin club and was invited to a national team training camp in March 2014, the prelude to his appearance in the coach\u2019s 23-man list for Brazil 2014. \\xa0 "}, {"Ignazio ABATE": "Easily recognisable thanks to his blond hair and white boots, Italy and AC Milan right-back Ignazio Abate is the son of former Udinese and Inter Milangoalkeeper Beniamino Abate. Very quick and always keen to get forward, the 26-year-old enjoyed a rapid impact at international level, needing just a few months to relegate Italy stalwarts Massimo Oddo and Gianluca Zambrotta to the sidelines. \\xa0 Abate rose through the ranks at Milan and was handed a first-team debut against Celta Viga in the UEFA Champions League on 3 December 2003, but he spent the next six years at a selection of clubs around Italy, having been loaned out to accelerate his progress. \\xa0 A winger when he first started out, Abate took up position on the right side of midfield during that spell, before being repurposed as a modern-style full-back when Leonardo brought him back to Milan in 2009. It was a shrewd switch, and two years later on 11 November 2011, Abate won his maiden Italy cap against Poland.\\xa0 \\xa0 A starter at UEFA EURO 2012, he contested three games in Poland and Ukraine and has racked up nine appearances in total, with his versatility making him an attractive option for Cesare Prandelli regardless of the system he implements. "}, {"Andrea BARZAGLI": "Formidable in the air and a fine tackler who gives away very few fouls, centre-back Andrea Barzagli is viewed by Italy coach Cesare Prandelli as a defensive stand-in of the highest quality. Since joining Juventus in 2011, he has played regularly alongside Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci in a three-man back line, and the trio have developed an understanding crucial to their performances with\\xa0.  \\r\\nHailing from Tuscany, Barzagli turned professional in 1998 at the age of 17, but he had to wait until August 2003 to make his Serie A debut, featuring for Chievo. The solid stopper impressed during his time at the Verona club and, 15 months later, after tying down a regular starting place with Palermo, he was handed his first Italy cap in a 1-0 win over Finland. Barzagli quickly proved his worth at international level and helped his country clinch the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122, yet his career took a serious dip following the 3-0 loss to the Netherlands at UEFA EURO 2008. The experienced defender decided to take his talents to Wolfsburg to get himself back on track, before eventually returning to Italy to sign for . After three years out in the cold, he was handed an Italy recall in 2011, hitherto occupying a starting berth in a three-man rearguard or a place on the bench when Prandelli opts for 4-4-2.\\r\\n"}, {"Leonardo BONUCCI": "Leonardo Bonucci is a vital component of the Italy defence, lining up in between Juventus team-mates Giorgio Chiellini and Andrea Barzagli. Born near to Rome, the centre-back joined Milan at the age of 18. His debut in Serie A came in May 2006, but competition for places meant his playing time with was limited. He was loaned out to Treviso and later Pisa, before being sold to Genoa who then agreed a co-ownership deal with Bari. Bonucci finally began turning heads while at the latter club in 2009/10, and he was snapped up by Juve at the end of the season. On the international stage, he was first capped aged 22 by Marcello Lippi, despite never having represented his country at any other age group. He started the match next to Fabio Cannavaro and Chiellini, and he became a permanent fixture in the side following the former\u2019s retirement and Italy\u2019s disappointing 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 campaign - in which he did not feature once. Since 2010, he has been a key figure in the  side, and equally valuable to the  line-up. The converted midfielder regularly earns praise for his excellent technique which allows him to distribute the ball with pace and precision. Physically imposing at 6\u20192, not to mention good in the air and inspired in his passing, Bonucci has all the attributes of the ideal modern centre-back. "}, {"Gabriel PALETTA": "The 21stArgentinian-born player to represent Italy, Gabriel Paletta is the most recent  talent to have been brought into the  fold. Athletic, tough in the tackle and strong in the air, he is most at home on the left side of central defence and could easily have been cut from the same mould as former  legend Roberto Ayala. Born in Buenos Aires, Paletta won the 2005 FIFA U-20 World Cup with his native country and represented the U-20s seven times overall but never made the step up to the senior team. He was therefore able to switch allegiances as he boasts dual nationality, his grandfather Vincenzo having emigrated to Argentina from Calabria. \\r\\nAt club level, Paletta started out at Banfield before leaving for Liverpool, where he spent most of his single season on the margins. The Anfield outfit subsequently let him join Boca Juniors and, after three years back in Argentina, the defender signed for Parma in 2010. That eventually brought him onto Cesare Prandelli's radar and the Italy coach handed him his debut against Spain in March, having spent several months trying to locate a new centre-back. Paletta has tended to suffer from ligament problems, but he is a solid presence at the back and steeped in football. Indeed, all three of his brothers are involved in the game at various levels: Hector is a referee, Ariel a stock-controller and Daniel a physical trainer. "}, {"Atsuto UCHIDA": "Schalke defender Atsuto Uchida sets many female football supporters\u2019 hearts aflutter, but beneath the handsome exterior is a fiercely determined, attack-minded player who is developing into a world-class right back. Now a regular starter in the Bundesliga, Uchida has also become an integral player for the Samurai Blue under coach Alberto Zaccheroni.  Uchida\u2019s professional career began at J.League giants Kashima Antlers while he was still a teenager. He nailed down a regular starting spot in his first season, and his penetrating runs down the right flank added an edge to Kashima\u2019s attack and contributed to the club winning three consecutive league titles. Uchida made his national debut in 2008, but despite being selected for the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 in South Africa, he spent the tournament on the bench.  To take his game to a higher level, Uchida signed for Schalke in 2010. He produced some eye-catching performances in the Bundesliga and Champions League, and the 26-year-old is now widely regarded as one of the finest members of Japan\u2019s European contingent. Strategically astute, skilful and quick, Uchida\u2019s understanding with Inter Milan\u2019s dynamic left back Yuto Nagatomo gives Japan genuine attacking options on both wings and could hold the key to the Samurai Blue\u2019s chances of reaching the quarter-finals at a FIFA World Cup for the first time.  "}, {"Gotoku SAKAI": "An attacking full-back with the full complement of skills, Gotoku Sakai is a rising star of Japanese football. Aggressive in defence, the 23-year-old has a penchant for breaking forward to create overlaps and poses a real threat with his accurate crosses and mid-range shots \u2013 often after cutting infield from the right.  Sakai began his professional career with Albirex Niigata and became a regular starter in 2010. Deployed as an attacking midfielder, he moved seamlessly through the national team age-categories while a teenager, announcing himself as a player for the future. Although he was not named in the squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122, coach Takeshi Okada chose him and attacking midfielder Shinji Kagawa as \u201csupport members\u201d to accompany the team to South Africa. Sakai represented Japan at the 2012 London Olympics, where he was central to the team\u2019s progression to the semi-finals.  In the winter of 2012, the player was loaned to Germany\u2019s VfB Stuttgart, before making his full international debut that same year. Moreover, his move to Stuttgart was made permanent in 2013, another indication that Sakai\u2019s career is on the rise.  Sakai can play on either flank but nonetheless faces intense competition for a starting berth. At right back, his rivals include Atsuto Uchida and Hiroki Sakai, who both also play in the Bundesliga, while Inter Milan\u2019s Yuto Nagatomo seems a shoo-in on the left.  "}, {"Yuto NAGATOMO": "Japan\u2019s premier left back, Yuto Nagatomo is a committed defender who adds a further dimension to his side\u2019s attacking threat thanks to his weaving runs and overlaps. The pocket-sized Nagatomo is a tireless worker, technically sound and can pass and shoot accurately with both feet\u2014qualities that have made the 27-year-old a regular starter for Inter Milan and the Samurai Blue.  Although Nagatomo is a household name in Japan now, he barely registered on the football radar during his high school years \u2013 perhaps a result of his family\u2019s long association with cycling and rugby. Even at Meiji University, he was perhaps better know for playing a drum in the stands during his team\u2019s games than for his on-field exploits. However, his fortunes changed dramatically after his coach at university converted him from a midfielder to an attacking wing-back.  Nagatomo\u2019s remarkable rise to prominence began in 2007, when he made his debut for J.League club FC Tokyo while still enrolled at university. The following year, he officially signed with the club and received his first international cap.  At the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 in South Africa, Nagatomo\u2019s skills shone through as he repelled the efforts of some of the world\u2019s top strikers. The manner in which he nullified Cameroon\u2019s ace striker Samuel Eto\u2019o in the opening group game and his tight marking during the tournament helped propel Japan to the Round of 16. Nagatomo was signed by Serie A club Cesena soon after the FIFA World Cup, and he joined Inter Milan in the winter of 2011. \\r\\n"}, {"Masato MORISHIGE": "A talented player equally at home in a defensive or holding midfield role, Masato Morishige has been knocking on the Samurai Blue door for several years. Born in Hiroshima Prefecture, he came through the junior system of local club Sanfrecce, but was not picked for the youth programme.  Morishige kept pursuing his football dream and after finishing high school made his professional debut for Oita Trinita. Although originally a defensive midfielder, Trinita converted him into a mainstay of a three-man backline. His improved performances saw him selected for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where Japan lost all three of their group games. Morishige had better luck with Oita that year as the club won the J.League Cup.  His reached a turning point in his career in 2010, when he was signed by FC Tokyo and formed a superb partnership with Japan\u2019s Yasuyuki Konno. Tokyo preferred to deploy Morishige again as a defensive midfielder, and he also became a free-kick specialist. Despite a relatively young age, his status within the side grew to such an extent that he has been captain since 2013.  Despite frequent call-ups to the national team squad, Morishige has struggled to get regular playing time. Nevertheless, his physical style of play could be a useful attribute at the FIFA World Cup\u2122 in Brazil. "}, {"Yasuyuki KONNO": "Yasuyuki Konno has been ever-present in the Japan squad in recent years, but the sturdy Gamba Osaka defender/defensive midfielder came within a whisker of giving up his dream of being a professional footballer before it had even begun.  Konno grew up in Miyagi Prefecture in north-eastern Japan, but local J.League club Vegalta Sendai did not offer him a contract after he finished high school. Just when Konno was resigned himself to playing amateur football, he received an offer to join Consadole Sapporo from former Samurai Blue coach Takeshi Okada, who had been impressed by his defensive nous and tenacity. Konno made the most of his opportunity and rapidly became a regular starter for Consadole in a midfield anchorman role, while he also went on to represent Japan at Under-20 and Under-23 level. In 2004, he transferred to FC Tokyo and started all three of Japan\u2019s group games at the Olympic Football Tournament Athens 2004.  Konno made his senior international debut the following year, but was not selected for the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122 in Germany. Konno enjoyed a renaissance in the national team when his old mentor Okada returned as Japan coach and he played briefly at South Africa 2010.  Comfortable playing anywhere in the defensive line or as a holding midfielder, Konno also has the knack for making crucial interceptions. Since 2012, the 31-year-old has lined up in the colours of Gamba, where he is an automatic starter alongside fellow international Yasuhito Endo. "}, {"Masahiko INOHA": "Masahiko Inoha is a versatile defender capable of playing anywhere across the backline and has also enjoyed success as a holding midfielder. While still at university, he was chosen for Japan\u2019s FIFA U-20 World Cup squad in 2005, although he would be an unused squad member.  Having tasted the big time, the teenager cut short his studies and signed with FC Tokyo the following year. However, a lack of starting opportunities there stalled his career, and in 2008 Inoha moved to Kashima Antlers, the team he supported as a boy. He helped Kashima win two league titles before a desire to take his game to a new level prompted a switch to Croatian first-division club Hajduk Split in July 2011. Problematic circumstances at the club resulted in Inoha soon returning to Japan, where he signed with Vissel Kobe in 2012. After Kobe were relegated at the end of that season, Inoha moved on to top-flight side Jubilo Iwata.  The 28-year-old is a tight marker who intercepts more than his share of passes thanks to excellent positioning, Inoha adds considerable steel to the defensive line. Coach Alberto Zaccheroni has regularly selected Inoha for the national squad, and perhaps his finest moment for the Samurai Blue came when he scored the winning goal in the 3-2 quarter-final victory against Qatar at the AFC Asian Cup 2011.

Eager to charge forward when the time is right, Sakai is known for his fearsome shot and flashing crosses. \\xa0 The 23-year-old burst onto the international scene when he scored for Kashiwa against Brazilian powerhouse Santos at the FIFA Club World Cup Japan 2011. That goal was especially sweet for Sakai, who has close ties with Brazil. After turning pro, he spent some time in Sao Paulo, where he was ingrained with a relentless work ethic in defence and attack. After returning to the J.League, Sakai\u2019s game blossomed and he became the bedrock of the Reysol defence. \\xa0 Sakai earned his first cap for Japan in May 2012 and was transferred to German club Hannover later that year. Santos were reportedly interested in acquiring the robust Sakai, and he will finally get a chance to grace the Brazilian stage during the FIFA Confederations Cup, where a mouth-watering match-up with star striker Neymar potentially awaits.

An excellent passer and header of the ball, Yoshida also possesses composure and leadership qualities that will be essential to Japan\u2019s prospects in Brazil.  After coming through the Nagoya Grampus youth academy, Yoshida benefited from the tutelage of coach Dragan Stojkovic, who played for Yugoslavia at the 1990 and 1998 FIFA World Cups\u2122. Stojkovic focused on the technical aspects of Yoshida\u2019s game, and his rapid improvement set him up for higher honours.  Yoshida became a pillar of the Samurai Blue defence after he transferred to Dutch club VVV-Venlo in the winter of 2010. Alberto Zaccheroni made him a central figure in his set-up, and he was vital to Japan\u2019s triumph at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. In 2012, he captained Japan as one of the over-age players at the London Olympics, where his side finished just outside the medals in fourth. This was Yoshida\u2019s second Olympics, and his experience was invaluable as he marshalled his younger team-mates.  In August that year, he signed for Premier League club Southampton. The 25-year-old has steadily developed into one of Asia\u2019s leading centre backs, a distinction that reflects his fine organisational skills and the aerial threat he poses from set pieces.

"}, {"Miguel LAYUN": "It has taken left-back Miguel Layun just two years to turn the jeers of the fans who said he was not good enough to play for America into cheers. No longer maligned, he is now regarded as a one of the key cogs in the  side that will take on the world at Brazil 2014.\\r\\nLayun caused quite a stir in the Mexican football media when, in 2009 and aged only 21, he left the then second-division side Veracruz for Atalanta. The full-back made only two appearances in Serie A, however, and returned home the following year to sign for mighty Club America.  fans were reluctant to embrace the little-known new arrival and took to the social media to blame him for the team\u2019s defeats.\\r\\nUndaunted, the young defender stuck quietly and determinedly to his task and used his pace, precise passing and long-range shooting skills to consolidate his place in the  first team. He proved influential in America\u2019s Clausura 2013 win, scoring the penalty that sealed the title for them.\\r\\nBy this time the fans that once criticised him had become his most vociferous supporters and urged his inclusion in the national team. Their calls were answered when Jose Manuel de la Torre brought him into the squad for the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Layun stayed in the frame under Victor Manuel Vucetich and Miguel Herrera, for whom he has become an essential component in Mexico\u2019s attack-minded 5-3-2 formation."}, {"Hector MORENO": "A key member of the famous \u2018Golden Generation\u2019 that lifted the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Peru, Hector Moreno has established himself as one of the Mexican national side\u2019s most important players over the last few years. A cornerstone of the Mexican rearguard, the centre-back\u2019s reliability has seen him become a firm favourite with fans at two different European clubs, first with Eredivisie outfit AZ Alkmaar and then with current team Espanyol, where he is one of their most highly regarded performers. An excellent man marker, the defender is comfortable with the ball at his feet and formidable in the air. He commits very few errors and knows how to motivate his team-mates when necessary. The 26-year-old has been linked with moves to some of the biggest clubs in Spain, Italy and England in the past, and that may provide him with an extra incentive to put in some strong displays at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122. \\r\\nWhile Moreno\u2019s profile outside of Mexico, Spain and the Netherlands remains low, it is possible that this summer could provide the springboard that catapults him to global stardom. "}, {"Miguel PONCE": "Though Miguel Ponce only sneaked into Mexico's FIFA World Cup\u2122\\xa0squad as a late stand-in \u2013 he was drafted in by coach Miguel Herrera after Juan Carlos Medina was ruled out through injury \u2013 the speedy, defensively disciplined left-back has everything in his locker to make an impression in Brazil. A member of Mexico\u2019s gold medal-winning squad at the 2012 Olympics in London, Ponce is not just a fine player: he also has an interesting story. The 25-year-old was actually born in the USA, namely in Sacramento, California, but with two Mexican parents and having spent his entire club career in Mexico, he was delighted when  came calling. The full-back was spotted by Chivas as a teenager and, after making his debut four years ago, chalked up a considerable number of appearances for the Guadalajara outfit. However, his performances have gone up a notch since a loan move to Toluca, forcing Ponce into contention for Brazil 2014, where the squad latecomer will be bidding to prove the truth of the expression \u201clast, but not least\u201d. "}, {"Andres GUARDADO": "Of all the Mexican players at the FIFA World Cup Brazil 2014\u2122, Andres Guardado is one of the most experienced in international football. The skilful 27-year-old left wingback has spent most of his career in Europe, making his name with a successful spell at Deportivo La Coruna before joining Valencia, and now at most recently Bayer Leverkusen.  \\xa0(little prince) has been ever-present for Mexico, surviving the various managerial changes that have taken place since his first outings. Over the years he has been considered one of\\xa0's most potent attacking threats, thanks in no small part to his speed and dribbling ability, but he now plays a more defensive role, both in club and country. Guardado also has some unfinished business at international level. Indeed, having been first-choice for most of Mexico's qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, he lost his starting role at the very end and was on and off the bench throughout the finals in South Africa.\\xa0 "}, {"Paul AGUILAR": "Ahead of the FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil 2013, Mexico's right-back position is one that remains very much up for grabs. Paul Aguilar was the first-choice option at the start of the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122, and he stands a good chance of reprising the role in Brazil.\\r\\n Since South Africa 2010, Aguilar has grown to become one of the most dependable right-backs in Mexican football. He made his name with Pachuca, his first club, before joining America, for whom he has impressed with his consistent displays in the past three short tournaments. As a fullback Aguilar tends to favour attack over defence, and he could provide a useful outlet if required by Mexico coach Jose Manuel de la Torre. "}, {"Ron VLAAR": "Firmly established as one of Louis van Gaal\u2019s first-choice centre-halves, Ron Vlaar was a near ever-present during the Netherlands\u2019 impressive Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign. At 29, the Aston Villa captain arrives at Brazil 2014 approaching his peak - and determined to make up for lost time. After all, Vlaar was one of the names cut from Bert van Marwijk\u2019s 36-man preliminary squad in 2010, and had to watch from home as his fellow countrymen marched all the way to the Final. His potential has long been recognised, with the former AZ and Feyenoord man a key player in the Dutch U-21 sides that won back-to-back European titles in 2006 and 2007. Establishing himself at senior level has proved more difficult, and despite finally gaining a place in the side by the time UEFA EURO 2012 came about, Vlaar and his team-mates endured a campaign that brought only disappointment and frustration.  Now, at the end of another tough season with Villa, battling in the lower reaches of the Premier League, this tall and commanding centre-half is determined to make an impression on the biggest stage of all.  "}, {"Stefan DE VRIJ": "One of several exciting prospects to have emerged from the Feyenoord youth system, Stefan de Vrij plays with an authority and composure that belie his tender years.  Though still just 22, he is firmly established as the Rotterdam outfit\u2019s captain, having assumed the armband at the age of 20 when Ron Vlaar departed for Aston Villa. That honour reflects the maturity with which the centre-half conducts himself on and off the field, and the respect that he already commands from team-mates for both club and country.  Such esteem\\xa0has been earned by consistently assured performances that have helped restore Feyenoord as a force to be reckoned with in the Eredivisie and established their young skipper as a recognised international.  De Vrij just missed out on UEFA EURO 2012, his name one of those cut from the provisional 36-man squad, but he has gone on to make nine appearances under Louis van Gaal since making his debut two years ago. The Netherlands coach clearly sees this classy defender as a future stalwart, and there will be plenty of big clubs watching with interest how he performs at Brazil 2014.  "}, {"Bruno MARTINS INDI": "One of the new generation of Dutch stars, Bruno Martins Indi has emerged as a key player for Louis van Gaal during the Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign. Tall, athletic and able to play at both left-back and centre-half, the Feyenoord player has proved himself well capable of rising to the demands of international football since making his senior debut at the age of 20 in August 2012.  Born in Portugal and raised in Rotterdam, where his family moved when he was just three months old, Martins Indi ended any debate over his allegiances by declaring for the Dutch in 2009. That was the year in which he first entered the international fray with a brief appearance at the FIFA U-17 World Cup in Colombia. Further progress at Feyenoord has followed, with manager Ronald Koeman saying that his young defender has the \u201cpotential to be world-class\u201d and tipping him to the Netherlands\u2019 first-choice left-back \u201cfor the next ten years\u201d. Indeed, Koeman has already conceded defeat in his bid to keep this talented youngster in Rotterdam, and it seems certain that Martins Indi - having nailed down a starting role during the preliminaries - will use Brazil 2014 as a springboard for the first major move of his fledgling career. "}, {"Daley BLIND": "Having spent the early stages of his career in the shadow of his father, Danny - a stalwart for Ajax and the Netherlands during the 1990s - Daley Blind is now beginning to carve out a formidable reputation of his own. Comfortable both at left-back and in a defensive midfield role, the 24-year-old featured in four of the  FIFA World Cup qualifiers and seems certain to be on the plane to Brazil.  Blind\u2019s breakthrough season came in 2012/13, when he was named Ajax\u2019s player of the year after excelling at left-back throughout the club\u2019s march to the title. More recently, though, he has been fielded by Ronald de Boer as a holding midfielder - a positional switch that has seen him dubbed \u2018the Dutch Philipp Lahm\u2019 - and his performances have been every bit as impressive.  Due to Nigel de Jong\u2019s hold on that position in the national team, it is at full-back that he has played most often under Lou Van Gaal, emerging as the team's first-choice No3 as the qualifying campaign reached its conclusion. And whatever role he plays at the FIFA World Cup, Blind\u2019s energy, composure and versatility are sure to make him a key player for the Netherlands for years to come. "}, {"Daryl JANMAAT": "The name of Daryl Janmaat is not yet well known outside of the Netherlands, but that\\xa0seems set to change over the coming months.  This 24-year-old right-back is, after all, seemingly assured of a place in Louis van Gaal\u2019s side, having started eight of the  ten qualifying matches en route to Brazil 2014. He is also being pursued by several of Europe\u2019s leading clubs, with London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur among those said to be battling it out over a likely summer move.  Feyenoord certainly appear to accept that they are fighting a losing battle in their attempts to hold on to a full-back whose pace, tackling ability and attacking instincts have established him as one of his country\u2019s hottest properties.  Janmaat, a graduate of the Rotterdam club\u2019s youth system who made his name with ADO Den Haag and Heerenveen before returning in 2012, has enjoyed a meteoric rise at international level.\\xa0Despite only making his debut in September 2012, he quickly made the right-back slot his own and seems sure to be a key component of the Dutch defence that lines up at Brazil 2014.  "}, {"Paul VERHAEGH": "Paul Verhaegh was a member of the Netherlands team that won the UEFA U-21 Championship in 2006, but rarely in the time since has he seemed likely to make the breakthrough at senior level. Indeed, it was only last August\\xa0- a month away from his 30th birthday\\xa0- that the right-back finally made his first full Oranje appearance in a friendly against Portugal.  Verhaegh\\xa0was nevertheless one of the surprise inclusions in Louis van Gaal\u2019s Brazil 2014 squad. Nonetheless, Van Gaal has evidently been impressed with the defender\u2019s consistent form for Augsburg, the German club with which he has played since 2010.  A fine defensive record was certainly\\xa0one of the main reasons behind the Bavarian outfit emerging as one of the Bundesliga\u2019s success stories of 2013/14, and Verhaegh now has the chance to cap the season in style with an unlikely role in Brazil. "}, {"Joel VELTMAN": "Already with two Eredivisie titles under his belt at the age of just 22, Joel Veltman is one of the most highly rated young centre-halves in European football. Indeed, the Ajax star is reported to have his pick of England\u2019s top clubs should he chose to leave Amsterdam, with Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and the two Manchester clubs all strongly linked.  The Dutch champions, though, are determined to hang on to a player who has been vital to their recent run of success, with director and former Netherlands international Marc Overmars vowing: \u201cI will fight to keep Veltman. He is a massive talent... a sensation. We never expected him to make such an amazing breakthrough.\u201d  Veltman has benefited from the tutelage of another former star, Jaap Stam, at Ajax, and his development led to a first full international call-up last November. Typically, the 22-year-old marked his first cap by helping keep a clean sheet against Colombia, and hopes are high for his prospects at club and international level.  "}, {"Terence KONGOLO": "Terence Kongolo was arguably the biggest surprise in the FIFA World Cup\u2122 squad named by Louis van Gaal. After all, while the 20-year-old Feyenoord defender\u2019s ability has long been noted, it was only in the final months of the season that he became a regular in his club team.  Now, a season which, for the most part, was spent warming the bench will end with Kongolo heading to Brazil with his country\u2019s biggest names. The centre-half does at least have plenty of experience of international football at youth level, having represented the Netherlands at various stages from U-15 to U-21.  And while he is unlikely to feature in Van Gaal\u2019s starting XI in Brazil, look out for this athletic young defender becoming an increasingly important player for both club and country.  "}, {"Joseph YOBO": "Joseph Yobo has returned to favour under Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi to make it a hat-trick of FIFA World Cup\u2122 call-ups, having played in all his country\u2019s group matches in 2002 and 2010. The former Everton defender started his country\u2019s successful CAF Africa Cup of Nations campaign last year as captain and one of the guaranteed first-choice central defenders, but was restricted to substitute appearances after the opening game against Burkina Faso. Due to the successful nature of the partnership between Godfrey Oboabona and Kenneth Omeruo, Yobo was sidelined during the Super Eagles\u2019 triumphant World Cup qualifying campaign, failing to make a single appearance on the road to Brazil. As a result, he is a surprise inclusion by Keshi but adds a wealth of experience to Nigeria\u2019s squad. Making his full international debut in March 2001, after helping his country to the quarter-finals of the FIFA U-20 World Cup in his homeland in 1999, he played four games on the road to Korea/Japan and made his World Cup debut against Argentina, with Gabriel Batistuta scoring the deciding goal. He also played a key role in qualification for South Africa 2010, playing nine times as Nigeria reached the finals, only to be eliminated at the group stage once again. Yobo took on the captains\u2019 armband after the retirement of Nwankwo Kanu, and is set to lead Keshi\u2019s men at his third appearance at world football\u2019s showpiece event. "}, {"Efe AMBROSE": " Although he\u2019s only 24, Efe Ambrose has grown into one of the stalwarts of the Nigerian defensive line, usually taking up the role of right-back. However, he is a versatile player, able to cover in the centre of defence as well as in defensive midfield.  \\r\\nFor coach Stephen Keshi, Ambrose has filled the role of aggressive full-back, surging forward down the flank to offer options in attack. But he is athletic enough to cover back and control opposing wingers, as he showed at the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations, when he was named to the team of the tournament. He was a vital figure for the Super Eagles en route to their third continental title, and got stronger as the event wore on after being sent off in the opener. \\r\\nAmbrose has gained valuable experience as a member of the Nigerian teams at the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup and at the Olympic Football Tournament in 2008. In his club career, he began at Kaduna United, starting his professional career with the club in 2006. After a loan to Bayelsa United, he returned to Kaduna and helped them gain promotion. He became one of a number of Nigerians playing in Israel when he joined FC Ashdod in 2010, and two years later, he was signed by Scottish giants Celtic.  \\r\\nSince then, he has benefited greatly from playing for a top European club and gaining UEFA Champions League experience. He is rated so highly by club boss Neil Lennon that he was immediately inserted into the Hoops' Champions League line-up just three days after winning the Cup of Nations in February 2013. Ambrose, who continues to be a regular in the Bhoys' starting line-ups, has two league championship medals, as well as a Scottish Cup winner's medal to show for the two years that he has been with the club. "}, {"Azubuike EGWUEKWE": " If Nigeria ever need an imposing physical presence at the back, Azubuike Egwuekwe is their man. A towering central defender at almost two-metres tall, the Warri Wolves player is capable of dominating the box in the air.  \\r\\nHe is also a very committed player, who even cut short his honeymoon earlier this year to travel to Tunisia to play in a CAF Confederations Cup match for his club. He has surprising mobility and is capable of tackling with both strength and timing, making him a vital asset for Stephen Keshi, who has made the 24-year-old one of the key domestic-based players in his team.  \\r\\nEgwuekwe, who captains his club side, has improved his confidence with the ball at his feet since debuting for the Super Eagles in 2012. He missed out on making an impact at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations last year due to a bout of chicken pox, but played in two Super Eagles matches at the FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil 2013. He was also a regular for his side at the African Nations Championship \u2013 a competition for which only locally-based players are eligible \u2013 in South Africa earlier this year. "}, {"Ebenezer ODUNLAMI": "Stephen Keshi has long been known to give local-based players a chance to play for the Super Eagles, and after taking Nigeria to third place at the African Nations Championship \u2013 a tournament for which only players playing in their local league are eligible \u2013 earlier this year, the coach said that he had earmarked some of the players for higher things.  One of the standout Nigerian players in South Africa was defender Kunle Ebenezer Odunlami, and Keshi sang his praises after the tournament. \"He was great. A lot of people didn\\'t know him before now, but I think everyone can see with his performance that we have a lot of talent in the Nigerian league back home.\u201d The Sunshine Star defender in turn said at the time that he hoped that he would still come in contention for a place at the 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 finals. \u201cI am happy that people appreciated what I did, especially the coaches.\u201d Odunlami, who can play in central defence or as a right back and first played for the national team in 2013, was selected for Keshi\\'s initial World Cup squad. The 24-year-old started in Nigeria\\'s friendly against Scotland in May, picking up an injury that forced him to be replaced with 15 minutes to go. He recovered in time though to travel to the Super Eagles\\' training base in the US and be given the nod to make the trip to Brazil. "}, {"Juwon OSHANIWA": "Defender Juwon Oshaniwa is one of a number of Nigerian players who has made Israel their temporary home. The 23-year-old joined FC Ashdod in 2012 \u2013 the same year he played his first match for the Super Eagles. He then made Stephen Keshi's squad for the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa, where the west Africans won their third continental title. Following that triumph, he played in Nigeria's first two 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifiers but somewhat fell off the radar thereafter, as Keshi gave other players the opportunity of competing at the highest level. Oshaniwa, who is a speedy left back, was close to signing for Celtic at the start of last year and was also keenly followed by Swiss club FC Basel, but in the end stayed with Ashdod. His inclusion in Keshi's extended squad for the World Cup drew some raised eyebrows and the coach, who is known for not shying away from hard decisions, kept Oshaniwa on the bench in the two friendlies (a goalless draw against Mexico and a 2-2 draw against Scotland) the Super Eagles played before the final squads had to be registered. However, when Keshi announced his 23-man squad for Brazil, Oshaniwa was included in the list alongside first choice left back Elderson Echiejile. "}, {"Godfrey OBOABONA": "One of the revelations of the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations, Godfrey Oboabona was previously little known outside of his home country. However, he was one of the key Nigeria-based figures for coach Stephen Keshi at the finals, playing with confidence and strength in the heart of the Super Eagles defence against the best that Africa had to offer.  It was an eye-opening performance by the 23-year-old and Keshi, who was a defender in his time as a player, has been a big fan of Oboabona since taking over the team. Along with goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama, Oboabona was the only player to play every minute in Nigeria's 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifiers, as well as the country's FIFA Confederations Cup campaign.   \\r\\n Physically powerful and athletic as well as precocious in terms of positioning and anticipation, he is also capable of playing at right back. His impressive performances last year saw him linked with a number of European clubs, including Arsenal. He ended up signing for Turkish club Caykur Rizspor in June 2013 and looks set to continue his upward trajectory through the World Cup. "}, {"Kenneth OMERUO": " Kenneth Omeruo is yet another of the Super Eagles players who has already tested his mettle on a global stage despite his tender years. The young defender, who could be one of Nigeria\\'s standout players in Brazil, was in Nigeria\\'s side that lost in the final of the FIFA U-17 World Cup at home in 2009.  \\r\\nTwo years later he was a member of the Flying Eagles squad that made it to the quarter-finals of the FIFA U-20 World Cup Colombia 2011. He went on a two-month trial to Anderlecht after the U-17 finals but returned to Nigeria until he was snapped up by another Belgian club, Standard Liege. After the U-20 finals, Chelsea took him under contract, but straight away loaned him out to Dutch club ADO Den Haag to gain some experience, and Omeruo was obviously quick to learn as he featured regularly and received a call up to the Super Eagles side. \\r\\n So impressive were Omeruo\\'s performances in the Dutch Eredivisie that Nigerian coach Stephen Keshi nominated him for the 23-man squad for the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations finals in South Africa. The then 19-year-old came on as a substitute in the first game against Burkina Faso and stayed in the team, keeping out experienced captain Joseph Yobo as the Super Eagles went on to lift the trophy.  \\r\\nOmeruo decided that, to be best prepared for the FIFA World Cup Brazil 2014\u2122, he would need to play regularly and moved to English Championship club Middlesbrough on loan at the beginning of the year after his loan period with Den Haag expired. Qualifying for Brazil was special for Omeruo, who grew up playing football barefooted in Abuja. \"I\u2019ve been dreaming of playing in the World Cup,\" he said. \"Playing in the Confederations Cup gave us an even greater desire to be in the World Cup.\u201d "}, {"Bruno ALVES": "Son of the former Brazilian footballer Washington Alves, Bruno Alves was born in Povoa do Varzim, a small coastal town near Porto. And it was on the beach that he developed the skills that make him one of the most versatile central defenders in Portuguese football. The footvolley games that he played with his family gave him a tremendous jumping ability. He found this talent only increased when he played on grass, and his strength in the air quickly became one of this determined athlete\u2019s great strengths. Although not especially tall (6\u20192\u201d), the central defender is fearless when it comes to attacking high balls, both in defence and closer to the opponent\u2019s goal. This characteristic has been a vital part of his success with the Portuguese national team, for whom he is soon to make his second FIFA World Cup\u2122 appearance. Ironically, if Bruno Alves is known for his towering leaps on the pitch, the player built his football career in short, gradual steps. He played for a number of clubs before establishing himself at Porto in 2005/06. His reputation at the club continued to grow, and he was soon named Porto captain. He was first choice for Portugal when the country made it to the Round of 16 at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa, before leaving Porto to spend three seasons with Zenit in Russia. He then moved to Turkey, where he plays for Fenerbahce. \\r\\nOne thing, however, has not changed: his place in the Portuguese national team. A first choice throughout the team\u2019s World Cup qualifying campaign, Bruno Alves is looking forward to playing in his second World Cup in the country where his father was born "}, {"PEPE": "Around 14 years ago Pepe's life changed forever when, like so many other Brazilian footballers, he left his home country and travelled to Europe in search of new opportunities. Fate led him to the island of Madeira, where he played for Maritimo. After a short spell with the club\u2019s B team, he established himself in the first team. It was the first big step towards international stardom, both for Real Madrid and the Portuguese national team. After starring at Maritimo he was signed by Porto in early 2004/05. However the club, which had won the UEFA Champions League the year before, had a season to forget, and Pepe initially struggled. Yet within a year the Brazilian had become the leader of a three man defence created by Dutch coach Co Adriaanse. The system was perfect for Pepe\u2019s speed and tackling ability, and the player was a vital part of Porto\u2019s Primeira Liga title win in 2005/06. The team repeated the feat the following year, and Pepe became an idol to FC Porto\u2019s discerning fans, who were used to watching top class central defenders like Fernando Couto, Jorge Costa and Ricardo Carvalho. The defender\u2019s reputation grew, and in July 2007 he moved to Real Madrid, where it did not take him long to dispel the doubts of fans who questioned whether the defender was worth his \u20ac30 million transfer fee. Pepe\u2019s unforgettable summer continued when in August of the same year he was granted Portuguese citizenship, meaning he could be chosen for the national team. Needless to say, it did not take long for Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari to take advantage of the situation and call him up. \\r\\nThe first major tournament in which he played was UEFA EURO 2008, and he was also first choice for Portugal at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122. Since then, Pepe has become one of the undisputed stars of the Portuguese national team. He will return to his home country this June hoping to shine with the the five blue shields of the Portuguese crest on his shirt "}, {"Fabio COENTRAO": "Football is full of great players. But for every success story there are many more who tried and failed. Despite his undeniable talent, Fabio Coentrao has had to battle hard to reach his goals. When he made his debut in the Portuguese Championship, his performances for Rio Ave soon earned him a highly flattering nickname. Due to his skill and speed he was christened the 'the Figo of Caxinas' in recognition of his similarity to one of the greatest Portuguese players of all time, and a reference to his hometown of Vila do Conde. In 2007/08, Benfica swooped to sign the young left winger, giving him his long-awaited opportunity to prove himself on a bigger stage. But his early days at the Stadium of Light made many observers question whether the player would ever fulfil his undoubted potential. He was given few opportunities in his first two seasons with the Eagles and was eventually loaned to Nacional Madeira, Zaragoza in Spain, and Rio Ave. But Coentrao didn\u2019t give up, and his determination was rewarded when in 2009/10 Benfica coach Jorge Jesus identified him as the solution to the team\u2019s problems at left back. He started to play regularly and made \u00e2\\x80\\x8b\u00e2\\x80\\x8bhis debut for Portugal in the qualifying play-off for the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122. He has never lost his place since. \\r\\nHe was one of Portugal\u2019s best players in South Africa and in 2011 made the huge move from Benfica to Real Madrid, where he has continued to shine. Now he is ready to play in his second World Cup.

As a result, players who can perform in a number of positions are invaluable. Ricardo Costa is just such a footballer. After coming through the Boavista youth system, it was at neighbours Porto that he made his name, winning four Primeira Liga titles, and lifting the UEFA Cup in 2002 and the UEFA Champions League in 2004 under Jose Mourinho. In 2004 he played in the UEFA European U-21 Championship and in the Olympic Games, his first experience of major international tournaments. He was selected for the Portugal squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany, making an appearance in the play-off for third place, and also took part in the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122. \\r\\nRicardo Costa certainly does not lack experience. After Porto, he had spells at Wolfsburg and Lille before settling in Valencia, where he became one of the captains of the team. Along with Cristiano Ronaldo, in June he will become the first Portuguese player to play in three World Cups "}, {"Luis NETO": "Born in Povoa de Varzim, as was Portugal team mate Bruno Alves, Luis Neto had to travel far and wide on his rise to the Portuguese national side and the FIFA World Cup\u2122.  Both he and Bruno Alves are of Brazilian descent and have their footballing roots at Varzim, but it was on the island of Madeira while playing for Nacional that he began to give a good account of himself in the Primeira Liga.  His excellent performances attracted the attention of the Italian team Siena, where he was voted one of Serie A's most promising new players in the 2012/13 season. One season in Italy was enough to whet the appetite of Russian giants Zenit, where he once again met up with fellow countryman Bruno Alves, alongside whom he would later make his debut in the Portugal defence. Manager Paulo Bento first called him up to the national squad during the 2014 World Cup qualifying matches and he was given his first cap in a friendly against Ecuador in place of the injured Pepe, proving a sterling replacement for the Real Madrid centre-half.

One of manager Jorge Jesus' most reliable reserves en route to the 2013/14 Portuguese championship, Almeida went on to earn the right to play on the biggest stage in world football. A constant member of Portugal\u00b4s national youth squads, it was Belenenses who ushered him into the world of professional football, and his maturity beyond his years earned him a transfer to Benfica at the tender age of 20.  Although Almedia was loaned out to Uniao de Leiria in his first season, Jorge Jesus soon showed he had faith in the\\xa0youngster. Alternating between the first team and the reserves, he got valuable playing time and experience under his belt at the Stadium of Light.  Gifted with an incredible versatility which enables him to play at right or left-back and in midfield, he won his first cap for Portugal during the 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifiers, and after winning this season's Portuguese championship, he is now a first-rate option for \\xa0in Brazil.

However, after winning the championship with Benfica, the upcoming young players and fierce competition from within the squad led him to seek pastures new. Two seasons at Gil Vicente and three at Sporting Braga provided him with the maturity he needed to return to one of the country\u00b4s top teams, which, as fate would have it, turned out to be Benfica\u00b4s rivals from the nearby Alvalade Stadium. After moving to Sporting his tigerish style of play soon won over the fans and his regular first-rate performances opened the doors to the Portuguese national side. Manager Paulo Bento handed him his chance during the UEFA EURO 2012 qualifiers and he has not looked back since.

He moved to Russia in 2007, playing first for KAMAZ, then Kuban Krasnodar who he helped win the Russian second tier and promotion to the Russian Premier League. He has played for Dinamo Moscow since February of this year. Kozlov made his Russia debut in June 2013 against Portugal in a qualifying match for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, coming off the bench to replace the injured Aleksandr Anyukov.

Even though he seldom played in the qualifiers for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 the strong-willed 23-year-old defender has gained the trust of Fabio Capello and is now a fixture in his squad. His participation in the U-21 European Championship was far from exemplary, clocking up three defeats and a red card in the group phase, but Capello deemed him mature enough to call him up a few months later. He made the last five squads in qualifying for Brazil 2014, but only got on the pitch at the end of the 4-0 thrashing of Luxembourg. In 2014 he again enjoyed playing time, in the friendly against Armenia, showing that he was ready to make the step up. He developed well during his club side CSKA\u2019s sensational 2013/14 campaign as an undisputed starter and was the hero in the semi-final victory in the Russian Cup.

Nailing down a first-team place with Khabarovsk, he proved himself to be a dependable centre-half. He would have to wait another three years before finally making his Russian Premier League debut, which came when he signed for Amkar Perm. Though he marked his first appearance with a goal, he played just 21 more matches for the club before moving on to Terek Grozny to help shore up their notoriously leaky defence. The Grozny outfit ended last season in 12th place, narrowly avoiding relegation.  Semenov\u2019s appearance in Russia\u2019s squad for Brazil 2014 has come as something of a surprise. The centre-back was called up to the national side for the first time for the 1-0 friendly defeat of Slovakia in May, a game he watched from the bench, with the first-choice pairing of Aleksei Berezutski and Sergei Ignashevich playing out the entire 90 minutes.

Now 30, the defender began his career back in 2003 at humble outfit Zvezda, in his home city of Irkutsk, though his fine performances soon saw him on the radar of other clubs. After first enjoying a spell at Dynamo Kyiv, where he won the 2006 Ukrainian Cup, he turned out for Volga and then Lokomotiv before a big-money move to Anzhi in January 2013.  Though relatively lacking in international experience, Eshchenko earned Capello\u2019s trust during friendly outings in late 2013 and early 2014.

He made his professional club debut that same year and enjoyed a successful first campaign, winning the Uruguayan championship and reaching the semi-finals of the Copa Libertadores. After the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2009, Coates decided against a move to Europe and instead stayed at Nacional, where he soon picked up another league title.  (The Boss), as he is known, capped 2009 with a call-up to Oscar Tabarez's Uruguay squad for the play-off against Costa Rica for a place at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122. He was not used in that game, though, and did not make s squad for South Africa 2010. The young defender continued to impress, however, and was eventually given his senior international debut by Tabarez in a friendly ahead of the 2011 Copa America. He then started the continental competition on the bench, but finished as a regular part of the starting line-up that won the championship. Coates has found his opportunities limited at Liverpool since moving to England, and has so far only featured in two qualifiers for Brazil 2014. He did, however, play in all three of Uruguay's games at the Men's Olympic Football Tournament London 2012, and remains a regular member of Tabarez's senior squad despite picking up some injuries.\\xa0 \\xa0 "}, {"Martin CACERES": "An established top-flight performer for some time now, Juventus and Uruguay defender Martin Caceres may not yet be at his peak, even though he lost some playing time at .

Promptly loaned out to fellow La Liga side Recreativo Huelva, Caceres performed so well that, after also featuring in all four of Uruguay\u2019s games at the FIFA U-20 World Cup Canada 2007, Oscar Tabarez soon handed him his senior debut for La Celeste. Selected as part of La Liga\u2019s equipo revelaci\u00f3n for 2007/08 and earning a switch to FC Barcelona, Caceres was busy at international level becoming an important component of Uruguay\u2019s backline in 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying. And though he only made two appearances at South Africa 2010, Caceres was a member of the Uruguay squad that won the 2011 Copa America.

Currently the main man in the centre of defence for Major League Soccer giants LA Galaxy, Gonzalez rose to prominence for the Stars and Stripes during the grueling qualifying campaign for the Brazil 2014.  His transition to life as an international centre-half was far from seamless, but coach Jurgen Klinsmann kept faith in his big man at the back and Gonzalez\u2019s education in the exigencies of international football proved fast and thorough. His presence on the pitch offers the US a focal point on attacking set-pieces, with his height and leaping ability a weapon any coach would covet. \u201cI'm good in the air, it's one of my strengths,\u201d he told . \u201cBut my best is yet to come.\u201d \\r\\nGonzalez became a hero for his Southern California club when he helped clinch silverware in 2012, earning man of the match honours in MLS Cup, the one-off game that decides the league\u2019s champion.

The consistency that might have surprised some USA supporters would have in no way taken Sporting Kansas City supporters unawares. Besler is the defensive rock for a club that prides itself on winning every ball and harrying the opposition into costly mistakes. It was just this kind of assurance in the centre of defence that helped SKC to last year\u2019s MLS league title.  Besler\u2019s only real competitive tournament experience for the Stars and Stripes came last summer when he was called in to take part in Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s experimental side for the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

Independiente was his last stop before a move to Europe, where his displays with Anderlecht persuaded Sergio Batista to draft him into the full national team in February 2011 and to include him in the squad for the Copa America later that year. Though he has not always figured in Sabella\u2019s plans, his excellent form in Belgium, which saw him elevated to the Anderlecht captaincy and score the goal that sealed the 2013 title, earned him a move to Lazio and a recall to the national side.

Though he has not quite reached Francescoli\u2019s heights, the 28-year-old has had a solid career since coming through the ranks at Mendoza side Godoy Cruz, where he made his debut as a 17-year-old in the Argentinian second division. In 2007 he made the step up to Estudiantes, where he enjoyed substantial success under Sabella, winning the 2009 Copa Libertadores and the 2010 Apertura title and claiming a runners-up medal at the FIFA Club World Cup. Perez was given his senior Argentina debut by Diego Maradona in 2009. He played once on the road to the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 but did not make the final squad for South Africa. Current  coach Sabella knows the midfielder\u2019s game inside out, even if he barely used him after recalling him to the international set-up midway through qualifying for Brazil 2014.

He bounced back in style representing the Young Socceroos at Netherlands 2005, having been appointed co-captain by Postecoglou, and was also national team skipper of the U-23 team as they successfully qualified for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.  A strong all-round game means Milligan offers value to any team through his versatility. Throughout his career he has played in all positions across the back-line as well as in central midfield. It is in the latter position where he lines up for A-League side Melbourne Victory, and it is here he is likely to feature for the Socceroos. Milligan reads the game well, and is adept with a short passing game, as well an impressive ability to play long raking balls.  Milligan has played for three A-League clubs, as well as stints in China and Japan, but it is at Melbourne Victory over the past two years that he has blossomed. One of Postecoglou\u2019s final acts as Victory coach before taking the national team reins last October was to appoint Milligan team captain.  Milligan is just one of a handful of Socceroos to attend three FIFA World Cups\u2122, although he failed to get on the pitch at either Germany 2006 or South Africa 2010. Milligan was a shock Guus Hiddink selection for the former with the 20-year-old one of only two A-League players included in the 23-man roster. He made his first Socceroo start a few days prior to Germany 2006 against Liechtenstein alongside fellow debutant Josh Kennedy. In the current World Cup campaign Milligan made six appearances including in the pivotal final qualifier against Iraq.  "}, {"Tommy OAR": "Slight in stature but big in heart, Oar is a jet-heeled left-winger who likes to run at fullbacks and deliver crosses from wide areas.  One of numerous Queensland products to come through the ranks in recent years Oar has been ear-marked for a prosperous career after being fast-tracked into the Socceroos side just prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122, although he was eventually named only as a stand-by player. His breakthrough at a tender age and surging runs down the left earned him media comparisons with Socceroos icon Harry Kewell.  He played in five of Australia\u2019s Brazil 2014 qualifiers scoring an unusual deflected goal in Saitama which had the Socceroos set for a famous victory until Japan equalised in injury time.  Oar was a key member of the Young Socceroos team which competed at the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Colombia, and his spectacular long-range goal\\xa0against Ecuador was named the tournament\u2019s best.  After two seasons with Brisbane Roar, Oar\\xa0joined Dutch Eredivisie club FC Utrecht in 2010 along with fellow Australians Adam Sarota and Michael Zullo. Oar soon found his feet in the Netherlands and has been a permanent fixture for the club over the past three seasons. "}, {"Oliver BOZANIC": "A busy midfielder capable of playing in an attacking or holding role, Bozanic is highly regarded for his short accurate passing and high tempo movement which makes him a good fit for Ange Postecoglou\u2019s methodology.  Bozanic has long been a candidate for senior national team honours being a former U-17 and U-23 captain, as well as representing the U-20 national team. The gifted left-footer is also the son of one-time Socceroo Vic who played for the national team in 1980.  Like James Holland, Bozanic is a product of the Central Coast region just north of Sydney. His senior career initially commenced in England\u2019s lower leagues with a variety of clubs, where he was on loan from Reading. Faced with limited opportunities, Bozanic returned to Australia in 2010 spending three successful years with Central Coast Mariners. Following the club\u2019s maiden championship win last year Bozanic returned overseas, this time with Switzerland club Luzern. He instantly settled into his stride immediately winning the Swiss league\u2019s Player of the Month award last August, and he has been a first-team regular throughout the most recent campaign.  Though called up for to the Socceroos squad in late 2009, he didn\u2019t make his debut until last October coming off the bench against Canada in what was Holger Osieck\u2019s final match at the helm.  "}, {"James TROISI": "A richly talented attacker who seems to be blossoming in confidence, and is now finally making good on years of early promise. Troisi can be used as a wide midfielder or in the forward line, and displays speed of thought and an ability to beat a defender or set a team-mate through on goal with an incisive pass.  Curiously Troisi\u2019s contract is shared by Serie A clubs Atalanta and Juventus, yet he spent the past season on loan at Melbourne Victory. Tellingly he was brought to the Victory by Socceroo boss Ange Postecoglou in one of his final acts at the club prior to assuming the national team reins. It has been a breakthrough campaign in some ways for Troisi, who finished the season as the league\u2019s second top scorer, while also providing the most assists in the league.  Adelaide-born Troisi has enjoyed successful stints at Turkish sides Kayserispor and Genclerbirligi, while he started out at English Premier League side Newcastle United as a raw teenager, though without ever seeing game time at St James\u2019 Park.  Troisi debuted for the Socceroos in 2008 as a 19-year-old and has made infrequent appearances over the past six years. "}, {"Mile JEDINAK": "As captain of newly-promoted Crystal Palace, Jedinak became something of a lone beacon in the English Premier League this past season for Socceroo fans accustomed to watching numerous Australians in the English top flight over the past two decades. And Jedinak didn\u2019t let his club or country down with consistent performances in the heart of midfield for the south London side.  He is likely to be one of the first names on Ange Postecoglou\u2019s teamsheet in Brazil, lining up as one of two defensive midfielders. It was Postecoglou that gave Jedinak his first international experience over a decade ago at the 2003 FIFA U-20 World Cup.  Tall and athletically built, Jedinak is not only a tough-tackling midfielder with a venomous shot, but he also boasts strong technical ability and leadership. The Sydneysider may have a thoughtful off-field demeanour, yet he possesses a steely determination to succeed.  Following his time with the Young Socceroos and a season in Croatia \u2013 the nation of his parentage \u2013 Jedinak spent a season playing semi-professional football in Sydney.  But, perhaps proving his mental fortitude, Jedinak bounced back signing for A-League side Central Coast Mariners where he made an immediate impact, helping the club to an unlikely championship.  Jedinak spent two and half seasons at Turkey\u2019s Genclerbirligi, before making the move to London. Consistent\\xa0inspirational displays saw Jedinak quickly become a fans' favourite at Selhurst Park, and donning the captain\u2019s armband he led the club back into the Premier League with a thrilling play-off win. 2013 proved a breakthrough year for Jedinak who was named both Palace and Australian player of the year.  Jedinak made his international debut in 2008, and featured at South Africa 2010, playing just once as Australia crashed to a 4-0 defeat against Germany in their tournament opener. He has since firmly established his place in the side, featuring at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup where he scored twice. Jedinak wore the captain\u2019s armband for the first time in March\u2019s international against Ecuador. "}, {"James HOLLAND": "A central midfielder by trade Holland is finally starting to make good on his early promise when he burst onto the A-League scene as a 17-year-old in 2007. One of the few Socceroos to hail from the Central Coast region just north of Sydney, Holland boasts a high-energy all-round game backed by an eye for goal.  Captain of the Young Socceroos at the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup, Holland struggled to make an impact when he joined Dutch Eredivisie side AZ Alkmaar where he linked up alongside fellow\\xa0Australian Brett Holman. A loan spell at Sparta Rotterdam was marginally more productive, however Holland\u2019s club career finally came of age three years ago with a move to Austria Vienna. Holland is highly rated by the capital club enjoying regular game time, including in the UEFA Champions League during the most recent season.  Holland made his senior international debut aged just 19 way back in 2008, but it is only over the past two years that he has forced his way back into the national team picture, firstly under Holger Osieck and now Ange Postecoglou.  "}, {"Matt McKAY": "Somewhat of a late bloomer at international level McKay didn\u2019t establish himself in the national team until he was 28, finally nailing down a spot at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup where he played every game, subsequently becoming a virtual ever-present during Holger Osieck\u2019s tenure.  Most of McKay\u2019s appearances for the Socceroos have been in the troublesome left-back position however he plays his club football in central midfield for Brisbane Roar.  McKay is another player given his international start by Ange Postecoglou at youth level, and he featured for the Young Socceroos at the 2003 FIFA U-20 World Cup alongside Mile Jedinak. Postecoglou also appointed McKay captain at Brisbane where he led the team to the first of the club\u2019s successive championships during the coach\u2019s tenure.  McKay has featured for hometown club Roar since the inception of the A-League in 2005 although he has had brief spells with Korea Republic\u2019s Busan IPark, China\u2019s Changchun Yatai and Scotland\u2019s Rangers.  He plays with seemingly limitless energy providing inspiration to his team-mates in the process, and is also a tidy and efficient passer of the ball making him a perfect fit for any Postecoglou-coached side.  "}, {"Dario VIDOSIC": "A slight-built but speedy right-sided wide midfielder, Vidosic is a technically gifted player who likes to take on the defence down the flanks.  Born in Croatia he moved to Australia as an infant. He played for hometown club Brisbane Roar, before becoming one of several Aussies to head for German club Nuremberg. Opportunities remained infrequent as they were during brief loan spells at Duisburg and Arminia Bielefeld. Vidosic returned to the A-League for two seasons with Adelaide United, but last year went back to Europe with Sion, a club which once featured current Socceroos assistant coach Aurelio Vidmar.  Vidosic featured prominently during the U-23s' lengthy qualifying campaign for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but was omitted from the squad which went to China. Vidosic debuted for the Socceroos a year later in the final match of the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying cycle, and made two further appearances during the Socceroos successful run to Brazil 2014.  His father Rado has been assistant coach at Sydney FC over the past two seasons, having enjoyed a hugely successful period at Brisbane Roar in tandem with new Socceroos boss Ange Postecoglou.  "}, {"Massimo LUONGO": "Massimo Luongo\u2019s unexpected call-up for Australia\u2019s international against Ecuador in March had media scrambling for information on the little-known 21-year-old attacking midfielder.  With an athletic build Luongo provides a presence in the centre of the park but also looks to be creative and busy around the opposition penalty area.  Sydney-born and raised to an Italian father and Indonesian mother, Luongo unusually missed Australia\u2019s traditional academy-based development pathways and remarkably moved straight from Sydney junior club football to Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s youth team at the age of 18. He played just one League Cup tie for the senior side, before a loan spell at Ipswich Town. He then departed north London last year joining third-tier Swindon Town on a full time basis where he was an ever-present throughout the most recent season.  Having briefly featured for the national U-20 team in 2011, Luongo came off the bench for his senior Australia debut against the Ecuadorians, but failed to get on the park in Australia\u2019s farewell home match against South Africa late last month.  "}, {"Mark BRESCIANO": "One of just a handful of survivors of Australia\u2019s breakthrough showing at the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122, Mark Bresciano has held onto his place in the team despite a massive overhaul since Ange Postecoglou assumed the reins late last year.  Bresciano is renowned as a ball-playing attacking midfielder with an eye for goal, and his dead-ball delivery has also long been a valuable asset for the national team. Bresciano will likely provide a central option for Postecoglou in Brazil, sitting in front of two deep midfielders in what will surely be his national team swansong.  Having made his national debut at the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, Bresciano is comfortably the longest serving member of the national team squad.  Now 34, Bresciano can look back on a magnificent career for both club and country. He spent 12 years in Italy, including nine seasons in Serie A which concluded in 2011 after a final campaign with Lazio. Much of his club, and indeed international, career mirrored that of great friend and fellow Melbourne native Vince Grella.  Since departing Italy, Bresciano has plied his trade in United Arab Emirates, and now in Qatar with Al Gharafa. However, the most recent season was disrupted by a ban imposed due to club irregularities involving his transfer from UAE to Qatar.  Bresciano has scored numerous crucial goals for Australia, most notably the only goal of the intercontinental play-off against Uruguay in 2005, with the Socceroos eventually prevailing on penalties to break their 32-year FIFA World Cup drought.  Quietly spoken, Bresciano is often somewhat of an unheralded hero for the Socceroos. More recently Bresciano provided the cross for Josh Kennedy to score the winner in the final qualifier against Iraq, which booked Australia\u2019s passage to Brazil.  "}, {"Axel WITSEL": "The only outfield squad member to have played every single minute of Belgium\u2019s 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifying campaign, Axel Witsel is one of Marc Wilmots\u2019 most trusted lieutenants. While his versatility enables him to perform anywhere in middle of the park, the position that he occupies most often for  is holding midfielder.  \u201cWitsel has grown into that role. I put him there because he\u2019s got the best tactical brain. He holds onto possession and works for the good of the team. He carries out my ideas on the pitch,\u201d explained the Belgian coach. The Martinique-born midfield man began his career at Standard Liege, where he enjoyed five fruitful seasons, winning two Belgian Pro League titles, a Belgian Cup and two Belgian Super Cups. In 2008, he was named Belgian Footballer of the Year and was capped for his country for the first time. Three campaigns later, he decided to try his luck abroad and signed for Benfica. The combative Belgian did not regret his choice, playing 52 matches and scoring five goals in one season, and attracting the interest of Zenit St. Petersburg in the process. He put pen to paper with the ambitious Russian club in September 2012. "}, {"Kevin DE BRUYNE": "The leading goalscorer during Belgium\u2019s 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying campaign, Kevin de Bruyne is \u2013 alongside Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and Axel Witsel \u2013 one of the stars of his country\u2019s much-vaunted \u2018golden generation\u2019. A versatile midfielder, he has become known for his vision and powerful shooting skills. \u201cIn the middle or on the right \u2013 Kevin de Bruyne can play anywhere. He\u2019s a very disciplined player. He\u2019s capable of delivering great final balls and upping the tempo of a match,\u201d said Marc Wilmots of the player upon whom \\xa0(Red Devils) are sure to lean heavily on in Brazil. \\r\\nHe got his first taste of professional football with Genk, where he made remarkable progress and landed the Belgian Pro League title and Belgian Super Cup in 2011. The young playmaker\u2019s performances earned him rave reviews in his homeland, which in turn led to interest from big-name foreign clubs. It was Chelsea who finally captured his signature, but the London side promptly sent him on a season-long loan to Werder Bremen. De Bruyne enjoyed a productive campaign in the Bundesliga, making 33 league appearances and scoring 10 goals. Upon returning to the Blues in the summer of 2013, he found playing time hard to come by due to the intense competition for places at Stamford Bridge. Consequently, he decided to move on, joining Wolfsburg in January 2014, much to the delight of the club\u2019s loyal fan base. "}, {"Marouane FELLAINI": "Everton fans were left scratching their heads when the club broke their transfer record to lure Marouane Fellaini from Standard Liege for close to \u20ac20m in 2008. For supporters, the newcomer with the distinctive hairstyle was an unknown quantity, but Everton were convinced they had picked up one of the game's rising talents, and a player capable of tearing around the pitch for 90 minutes applying tackles or finding the net. Fellaini soon proved them right, and as his goal tally grew so too did his reputation. Also on the rise were sightings of afro wigs at Goodison Park, with the Everton faithful keen to pay homage to their new hero. \\r\\nUsed as a holding player during his Standard days, Fellaini has been a model of versatility since moving to England. Often tucked in behind the strikers at Everton, or even positioned up front, the 6'4 midfielder boasts a broad range of qualities, and it was only time before bigger clubs took an interest. The Toffees held them off at first yet they eventually succumbed when Manchester United won his signature last year. Expectations were high on both sides, but Fellaini experienced a testing start to his Old Trafford spell, struggling to find his rhythm in the United midfield. Despite those early issues, he has stuck at his task, convinced he has much to contribute.\\r\\nThe Brussels native has certainly proved that in the past, and not least for Belgium, having won his maiden cap against the Czech Republic back in 2007. He has been an integral player ever since and has served his country with distinction, notably hitting the winning strike against Serbia during 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifying. Fellaini knows how to best apply his skills for the good of the team, and although his focus can sometimes slip, his air of nonchalance is deceptive. 'Big Mo' is never far from the heart of the action, and is usually the first to apply a touch whenever the ball drops out of the air. "}, {"Eden HAZARD": "Eden Hazard tends to weave magic wherever he goes, having recently cast England under his spell after first waving his wand in France. Given his professional debut by Lille at 16, he notched his maiden goal almost 12 months later and then claimed back-to-back Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year awards, before following up with two consecutive Player of the Year wins. No footballer had ever made such a scintillating start in the French elite \u2013 but, of course, Hazard is no ordinary player. A wizard with the ball at his feet, the outrageously gifted schemer was always likely to outgrow Lille, and he opted to continue his development at Chelsea aged 21.\\r\\nNamed man of the match in his very first outing for the Blues, Hazard set the tone for his Stamford Bridge stay there and then. Reaching the same heights he scaled in France, he has made a habit of changing games single-handedly, and while the goals and assists have flowed, so too has the praise. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho rates Hazard as the best young player on the planet, and Zinedine Zidane believes he fits the profile to slot in seamlessly at Real Madrid. Hazard himself, meanwhile, has voiced the ambition of one day winning the FIFA Ballon d'Or, having dreamt of lifting the trophy since childhood. \\xa0\\r\\nHis talent is likewise evident in a Belgium shirt, though the midfielder has struggled to impart the same degree of influence he generates in the club game. First capped in a friendly against Luxembourg at 17, he required three years to plunder his first international goal, eventually opening his account versus Kazakhstan. Soured relations with former coach Georges Leekens did not help, and for a while it seemed that supporters' expectations were weighing too heavily, with the youngster too anxious to do everything himself. Marc Wilmots' appointment ultimately changed the landscape, however, and Hazard has grown in both confidence and effectiveness, as demonstrated by his burst of pace and finish against FYR Macedonia in Brazil 2014 qualifying. \\xa0 \\xa0 "}, {"Dries MERTENS": " Skilful, lively and incisive, Dries Mertens may be small in stature, but \u2013 much like his similarly diminutive compatriots Eden Hazard and Zakaria Bakkali \u2013 he is clearly destined for big things.  Initially used as an impact substitute and then as a starter for Belgium, the Napoli winger was replaced at half-time during a FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying match versus Macedonia in March 2013, a decision he found hard to swallow, blurting out \u201cI\u2019d really like an explanation\u201d after the match. Since that faux pas, Marc Wilmots has continued to include him in his squads, without fielding him in any further qualifiers. However, consistently sparkling performances in warm-up matches for Brazil 2014 have seen the effervescent winger regain the confidence of his national coach.\\r\\nMertens started out at Gent, but it was actually at Dutch second division outfit AGOVV Apeldoorn that he made his name, putting in top-notch displays over the course of three seasons that piqued the interest of top-flight teams. As a result, the Leuven-born wide man moved to Utrecht in 2009, and was later transferred to PSV Eindhoven, with whom he lifted the Dutch Cup and Super Cup in 2012.  His final term with the  saw him score 16 goals and set up 17 more, a remarkable statistic that persuaded Napoli to come calling in June 2013. \\xa0 "}, {"Steven DEFOUR": "Having made his Jupiler Pro League debut at the tender age of 15, won his first cap at 18, and earned the Belgian Golden Shoe award at 19, Steven Defour was a footballing prodigy for whom his country\u2019s fan base had great hopes. Now 26, the dynamic international is doing his utmost to fulfil that potential, battling strong competition at Porto to hold down a first-team place - and thereby guarantee his place in the Belgian squad.\\r\\nOriginally a youth player at Mechelen, the diminutive midfielder moved to Genk after the former club got into financial difficulties. Following an impressive 2005/06 season, he joined Standard Liege, making history by becoming \u2019 youngest-ever captain at 18. Defour would enjoy great success in Liege, securing two Belgian League crowns, in 2008 and 2009, a Belgian Cup in 2011 and two Belgian Super Cups (2008 and 2009). After five years of loyal service, he exported his skills to  in Portugal, where he added further honours to his CV in the shape of two Primeira Liga titles and two Portuguese Super Cups, both in 2012 and 2013.  "}, {"Moussa DEMBELE": "Used by Belgium in every qualifying match for Brazil 2014, Moussa Dembele is one of Marc Wilmots\u2019 most valuable assets in midfield. Mobile and powerful, with strong ball-carrying skills, the left-footer is as capable of setting up goals as he is of scoring them himself, making him a real threat to any defence. \\r\\nOf Malian descent but born in Antwerp, he began his career as a raw 16-year-old with now-defunct Germinal Beerschot, his local club. His fine performances in the Belgian Pro League attracted suitors from far and wide, with Dutch outfit Willem II bringing him on board in 2005. A successful season ensued, during which he hit the back of the net nine times, followed by a transfer to AZ Alkmaar, where he developed as a player over the course of four seasons with the club, and captured an Eredivisie winners\u2019 medal in 2009. Dembele moved to the English Premier League the following year, starring for two seasons at Fulham and then for Tottenham, where he has since become a fixture in the starting XI. "}, {"Adnan JANUZAJ": "Adnan Januzaj is \"top quality\" according to Marc Wilmots, who included the youngster in his squad despite having suggested he would prioritise the players who helped Belgium end their 12-year FIFA World Cup\u2122 absence. The Manchester United winger proved impossible to overlook, however, after a season spent lighting up the English Premier League as one of its brightest new talents. As a result, Januzaj has been making quick introductions to the players he will operate alongside in Brazil, while also getting to know the man pulling the strings. \"He\\'s arriving in a squad whose rules he will have to learn and, above all, respect,\" said Wilmots. \"He\\'s climbing aboard a moving train and I\\'m the one who\\'s driving it. You either follow me or get off.\" Januzaj first announced himself to the world against Sunderland last October, when his two goals paved the way for a United victory. It was merely the first of many superb performances, with his exceptional work rate, supreme technique and passing acumen forming a heady blend along with his confidence and excellent reading of the game. Januzaj\\'s illustrious Old Trafford colleagues were soon won over, and the player who has made a habit of seizing chances will be desperate to prove his worth on the international stage. Belgium\\'s rivals have been warned. "}, {"Nacer CHADLI": "Able to play on the wing or as an attacking midfielder, Nacer Chadli is one of Belgium\u2019s most potent offensive weapons. Indeed, Marc Wilmots, who has become a big admirer of the Liege-born international\u2019s laudable attitude and excellent technique, relied on him heavily during \u2019 (Red Devils) impressive FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying campaign. Absent for his country\u2019s first two matches, the versatile two-footer went on to play a key role in the eight remaining qualifiers, and his presence in the 23-man squad certainly does not come as any great surprise. \\r\\nChadli has come a long way in a short time. Rejected by Standard Liege\u2019s youth academy, he even considered giving up football in 2005. He spent two years at MVV Maastricht before he was offered a professional contract by Dutch side AGOVV Apeldoorn, then competing in the second division. Chadli put in a number of strong performances over a three-year period, building a solid reputation in the process. Season 2009/10 saw him score 17 goals for the modest Gelderland club, a feat that brought him to the attention of Twente, the reigning Eredivisie champions. Within a year, the talented midfield man had earned his first cap for Belgium and hit the back of the net in a UEFA Champions League game. A subsequent move to Tottenham Hotspur confirmed his status of rising star, and he will no doubt be one to watch at Brazil 2014.

His fortunes took an upward turn, however, following a move to Celik in 2011. Vrsajevic impressed in his solitary season at the club, operating as an adventurous wingback, and that prompted Hadjuk Split to sign him. Vrsajevic has since excelled in Igor Tudor\u2019s side and helped them win the 2012/13 Croatian Cup.  Vrsajevic did not make his Bosnia-Herzegovina bow until 2012, when he was 26, but in the latter half of their 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifying campaign, he made a place in their starting XI his own.

Although small for a centre-back, Besic is equally adept at playing there or as a holding midfielder.\\r\\nBesic was born in Berlin and began his career with Hamburg. Disciplinary problems limited his first-team opportunities and prompted the club to sell him to Ferencvaros in 2012. In his first year in Budapest, he helped a team that had finished 11th the previous season end up fifth in the Hungarian top tier. Besic also starred in Ferencvaros\u2019s 5-1 victory over Videoton in the 2013 Hungarian League Cup final.

Safet Susic is, perhaps, fortunate to have the cerebral playmaker at his disposal. When Pjanic was a toddler, his family relocated to Luxembourg following the outbreak of the Bosnian War in 1992 and he went on to represent that nation at youth level.  Pjanic, then operating up front, scored Luxembourg\u2019s only goal \u2013 a stunning strike from distance \u2013 in a defeat by a Spain side including Cesar Azpilicueta and Bojan Krkic at the UEFA European U-17 Championship in 2006. After appearing for the Luxembourg U-19s, however, Pjanic elected to play senior international football for his birth country and made his Bosnia-Herzegovina bow as an 18-year-old in 2008.  Pjanic joined Metz\u2019s youth ranks aged 14, made his Ligue 1 debut three years later and impressed so much in his first season that, at its end, Arsenal, Barcelona, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid were all linked with signing him.  Lyon beat those giants to land the teenager, viewing him as a successor to club legend Juninho Pernambucano, whose No8 jersey Pjanic later inherited. He spent three successful years at the Stade Gerland before moving to Roma for \u20ac11m in 2011.  Pjanic initially struggled for playing time in the Italian capital, but became a regular in 2012/13 before exploding into one of Serie A\u2019s finest players in 2013/14, during which he has been coveted by some of the biggest club on the planet.

Mujdza began his career at NK Zagreb and helped them finish third in the Croatian top flight in 2006/07. He joined Freiburg ahead of the 2009/10 season and helped stabilize the newly-promoted club in the Bundesliga, before forming part of the team that surprisingly finished fifth in 2012/13 and consequently qualified for the UEFA Europa League. Mujdza was in and out of the Freiburg side in 2013/14. \\r\\nHaving previously played alongside Vedran Corluka, Luka Modric and Mario Mandzukic for the Croatia U-21s, Mujdza made his Bosnia-Herzegovina debut in 2010 and swiftly cemented a place in the team.

The son of former Yugoslavia international Sead Susic, and the nephew of his current national team coach Safet Susic, Tino Sven was born in Sarajevo but brought up in Belgium, where he father had played and was working as a football scout and agent.  Susic was in the academies at Vise and Genk, before joining Standard Liege as a 16-year-old. He didn\u2019t break into the Belgian powerhouse\u2019s first-team, but he did impress for Belgium at U-18 and U-19 level.  Hajduk Split took note and signed Susic in 2012. The youngster initially struggled on the right-wing, but was later tried out in behind the front two and just in front of the defence. When Igor Tudor assumed the Hajduk reins in 2013, Susic began to excel and in that year\u2019s Croatian Cup final, he performabed superbly in both legs \u2013 and scored in the second \u2013 as his side edged Lokomotiv 5-4 on aggregate.  Susic was eligible to represent Belgium and Croatia, but he declared himself interested only in representing Bosnia-Herzegovina and received his first cap in a friendly against Egypt in March 2014, before being summoned by his uncle for the trip to Brazil.

As well as providing a number of assists, the Lazio left-winger also broke the deadlock in the 5-0 win in Latvia.  When he was a child, Lulic\u2019s family fled the Bosnian War and settled in Switzerland, which is where he began his career with FC Chur before moving to Bellinzona, whom he helped gain promotion into the Swiss Super League. Lulic then had spells with established Swiss sides Grashoppers and Young Boys, for whom he netted nine goals in 40 games, before joining Lazio as a 25-year-old in 2011.  Initially expected to be a squad player, Lulic instantly cemented himself into the first-team and enjoyed a fine debut season in Rome, helping I Biancocelesti finish fourth in Serie A. His greatest day in a sky-blue shirt nevertheless came at the end of the 2013/14 season, when he ghosted in at the back post to prod home the only goal against fierce rivals Roma in the Coppa Italia final.

After hitting 16 goals in 23 games for Podgrmec in his homeland, Ibricic was snapped up by NK Zagreb in 2004. After four productive, prolific seasons in the Croatian capital, he made a \u20ac1.8m move to national giants Hajduk Split. Ibricic scored 35 times in 76 matches for Hajduk, including in both legs of their triumphant 2010 Croatian Cup final victory.  A cool \u20ac7m took Ibricic to Lokmotic Moscow in 2011, but he failed to recreate his form in Croatia and loan spells at Turkish teams Gaziantepspor and Kas\u00c4\u00b1mpasa ensued.

He was part of the Oranje squads that won back-to-back UEFA European U-21 titles in 2006 and \u201907, playing alongside the likes of Urby Emanuelson, Klass-Jan Huntelaar and Ryan Babel.  Medunjanin didn\u2019t see much playing time during four seasons with AZ at the start of his career, but he did impress during a loan spell at Sparta Rotterdam.

A move to top-flight team FC Wels ensued in 2007, and a couple of years later Hadzic represented Austria at U-19 level.  As either an attacking midfielder or on the wing, Hadzic starred for Ried in domestic competitions and the UEFA Cup, before a move to prestigious Sturm Graz in 2013.  He hit four goals and double figures in assists in 31 league appearances in his debut season for the club, in which they finished fourth in the Austrian Bundesliga.

The then-forward made his German top flight debut in 2004 but struggled for playing time at\\xa0Hertha and joined Hoffenheim in 2006.  Converted into a midfielder, Salihovic played a fundamental role in the club\u2019s leap from the third to the first tier of German football. His mix of defensive and offensive play even helped Hoffenheim lead the 2008/09 Bundesliga at its halfway stage, but an injury to his compatriot Vedad Ibisevic was chiefly behind them stumbling home in seventh.  Salihovic performed consistently over the following seasons and augmented his status at Hoffenheim on the final day of 2012/13. Requiring victory away to UEFA Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund to go into a relegation play-off rather than suffer automatic relegation, Salihovic converted two late penalties \u2013 both masterfully curled high into the net \u2013 to grab Hoffenheim a come-from-behind 2-1 victory. The Sinsheim outfit then beat Kaiserslautern home and away to retain their top-flight status.

None of which escaped the attention of Bayern Munich, for whom the player signed in 2011. Given his achievements with the Bavarian giants \u2013 before moving to the always ambitious Wolfsburg \u2013, it is only natural that Brazil recognition should follow. And, right from his first call-up back in 2011, the tall, composed left-footer, an adept ball-winner and passer, has been a frequent face in the set-up.

It is to his credit that that the long-running discussion was rendered largely meaningless by his consistently good performances over the years for Sao Paulo and Lazio.

A regular in the Chilean set-up in qualifying, although mainly in a bit-part role, Brazil 2014 will be Silva's first FIFA World Cup\u2122. A product of the Universidad Catolica academy, Silva found his path to the first team blocked in Santiago and only cut his teeth after being farmed out on loan to lower-league Deportes Ovalle in 2005. A further loan spell followed in 2007, this time at Osorno, where his performances during the club's promotion-winning campaign finally earned him a crack at the first team back at his parent club.  After starting out as an understudy to Gary Medel, Silva excelled when he stepped into his sizeable shoes and lifted the title in 2010, though not quite doing enough to force his way into the international picture in time for South Africa 2010. Having won his first senior Chile cap under Marcelo Bielsa in 2011, the midfielder was part of Claudio Borghi's squad at that year's Copa America in Argentina and went on to join Osasuna, initially on loan, in 2012.

He won three trophies under Borghi, as well as reaching the 2006 Copa Sudamericana, and was still a teenager when Nelson Acosta gave him his first senior Chile cap in a friendly against Venezuela. One of the stars of the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada, where several of the current golden crop of senior Chile internationals burst onto the scene, Vidal\u2019s performances earned him a move to Bayer Leverkusen.

By that time he was a regular in the international picture, having starred as a Chile U-23 side fell at the last hurdle in the Athens 2004 Pre-Olympic Tournament and during the unsuccessful qualifying campaign for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany.  A move to Palmeiras beckoned next, where the tricky schemer was named the best midfielder in Brazil in 2007, but he then grabbed the headlines for all the wrong reasons at that year's Copa America, being hit with a 20-match\\xa0ban by the Chilean FA for a disciplinary misdemeanour. On the pitch, though, Valdivia continued to dazzle, both in Brazil \u2013 where he lifted the 2008 Campeonato Paulista \u2013 and following a surprise move to the United Arab Emirates. Indeed, having had his\\xa0suspension reduced, he was handed an international recall by Marcelo Bielsa and\\xa0made a key contribution\\xa0in the latter stages of qualifying for South Africa 2010 and at the tournament proper, where Chile reached the Round of 16. The playmaker, now back at Palmeiras, went to the 2011 Copa America in Argentina, only to be\\xa0frozen out of Claudio Borghi's side following more off-the-pitch antics. The maverick's rollercoaster ride continued at club level, as the Green and Whites tasted glory in the 2012 Brazilian Cup and then experienced relegation and promotion within the space of 12 months.

He variously plied his trade in Chile, Switzerland, Brazil, Belgium and Mexico before making the move to England, where he has collected two major pieces of silverware: the 2011 Carling Cup with Birmingham City and the 2013 FA Cup with current club Wigan Athletic.  Beausejour's international career did not really take off until the arrival of Marcelo Bielsa in 2008, though he did appear at the U-23 qualifying tournament ahead of the Athens 2004 Olympics and in one qualifier for Germany 2006.

The Twente midfielder, who learned his trade at Deportes Temuco and Vi\u00f1a del Mar side Everton before bursting onto the scene at Universidad Catolica aged just 18, had an insider's view of Chile's South Africa 2010 campaign. Gutierrez wasn't a member of Marcelo Bielsa's 23-man squad, but rather one of the lucky youngsters taken along to train with and provide opposition for the first team.

Granted, he only played 21 minutes in qualifying \u2013 though that was enough time for him to get on the scoresheet against Argentina \u2013 but he was continually called up by Claudio Borghi and then Jorge Sampaoli.  Given such shows of faith, Gutierrez must have something going for him and the versatile 23-year-old has enjoyed success aplenty throughout his budding career.  While still in Chile, the creative midfielder won the title in 2010 and the cup the following year, when he was named breakthrough player of the 2011 Apertura tournament in recognition of his goalscoring exploits and performances in key matches. This\\xa0big-game temperament helped him adapt\\xa0seamlessly to life in European football after a 2012 move to Twente, where he\\xa0has\\xa0nailed down a place in the starting XI and improved his tactical nous, playing a key role in the club's third-place league finish this past season.

It would have been a great loss, as he has developed into a crafty, tigerish midfielder of the highest order, notable for his ability to win and distribute the ball, pick out passes and hit the back of the net. Shortly after this maternal intervention, which came when he was a 16-year-old at Cobreloa, Aranguiz began going places. Following a short loan spell at Cobresal, he returned to his parent club and then moved on to Colo-Colo \u2013 where he won the title \u2013 and Argentinian side Quilmes. He rose to even greater prominence at Universidad de Chile under a certain Jorge Sampaoli, who personally urged the club to buy 50 per cent of the midfield schemer\u2019s rights from Udinese in 2011. The pair would go on to lift four trophies together. Having made his senior international debut in 2009, Aranguiz failed to make the cut for the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 in South Africa and subsequently found himself in and out of the team under Claudio Borghi, who chiefly deployed him at wing-back. He returned to the engine room following Sampaoli\u2019s appointment as Chile head coach and made seven appearances in qualifying for Brazil 2014, scoring twice. Speaking of Brazil, that is where the dynamo is currently based: he has made waves since joining Porto Alegre side Internacional early in 2014, proving influential in the club\u2019s run to the Rio Grande do Sul State Championship title and picking up the most valuable player award along the way. "}, {"Marcelo DIAZ": "Within every squad there are players considered to be among the coach\u2019s favourites and Marcelo Diaz is a prime example of that phenomenon. The central midfielder has played a pivotal part in the Chile team ever since Jorge Sampaoli took over as coach at the end of 2012. Diaz, 27, began as a full-back in the youth teams at Universidad de Chile, but moved to Deportes La Serena in 2010 and impressed in midfield for his second side. Then, in 2011, Sampaoli took charge at  and pushed for the return of the club\u2019s former player. Diaz duly moved back and provided the balance in a very attacking outfit which won four local titles and the Copa Sudamericana. His impressive performances brought a call-up to Claudio Borghi\u2019s Chile side, for whom Diaz had participated in the 2005 U-20 FIFA World Cup in the Netherlands, albeit without playing a single minute. Under Borghi, his performances for  were inconsistent, but the Basel player has made the central midfield position his own since Sampaoli took over, impressing with his excellent positioning, his marking and his distribution. Now immovable in the Argentine\u2019s system for Chile, Diaz is equally important for a Basel side which claimed the Swiss title in 2012/13. "}, {"Mathis BOLLY": "After breaking through into the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire squad last year, Mathis Bolly said that playing at the FIFA World Cup\u2122 finals was his dream.  The forward who is said to be faster over 40 metres than the fastest man on earth, Usain Bolt, played in one game as  secured a third consecutive appearance at the finals. Injury saw him miss a large chunk of the season, and he only returned a few months ago \u2013 just in time to still make the west African country's Brazil 2014 squad. The Norway-born midfielder, who played for the Norwegian youth team, started his football career with Lillestrom, playing his first game as a 17-year-old when he came on in a Tippeligaen game against Stabaek in August 2008. After five seasons with Lillestrom, he joined Fortuna Dusseldorf and made his first Bundesliga appearance in March of last year.  A week later, he scored his first goal - beating none other than Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Disappointingly for him, Dusseldorf were relegated at the end of that season, but Bolly decided to remain loyal to the club, and has since fought his way through a frustrating 2.Bundesliga season. "}, {"Ismael TIOTE": "Yamoussoukro-born Cheick Ismael Tiote is a rugged, dogged and impressively consistent defensive midfielder. He first made waves in the high levels of European football with Roda JC, while on loan from Anderlecht at the beginning of the 2007/08 season. He had made his debut at the wealthy Belgian side two seasons earlier, at the age of just 19, but it wasn't until his season with Roda and subsequent move to Twente \u2013 where he won the Dutch league in 2010 \u2013 that he drew serious notice.  He made the Ivorian squad at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations in 2008 and also caught the eye in all three matches for the Elephants at South Africa 2010. With a move to a larger league on the cards, he moved to Newcastle United, and he has been one of the most consistent performers in his position in the English Premier League.  He has played over 100 league matches for the Magpies, captaining the club on several occasions. The 27-year-old, who turns 28 two days after his side play their second group game against Colombia at the World Cup finals, has been a mainstay for his national team as well, playing in six of the eight qualifying matches en route to Brazil. "}, {"Konan YA": "Didier Ya Konan first grabbed international headlines in 2006 when ASEC Mimosas managed to advance to the semi-finals of the CAF Champions League, and he finished third-top scorer with five goals. Egyptian giants Al Ahly put in a bid to buy Ya, but it was turned down as the  wanted to sell the striker to Europe.  Shortly afterwards, Rosenberg secured his services. He stayed with the Norwegian club for two years before moving to the German Bundesliga, signing for Hannover 96. He has since played well over 100 league matches for the club from the north of Germany, scoring at a return of 39 goals. His arrival in Hannover coincided with a change in fortunes of the club as they secured back-to-back qualifications for the Europa League. Ya, who is a very fast and technically gifted player with an eye for goal, first broke into the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire team in 2006, but although he was in the 2008 CAF Africa Cup of Nations squad, he failed to cement a regular place.

The St Etienne midfielder was called up for the Elephant\\'s second leg third round match against Senegal for the suspended Serey Die and Cheick Tiote, but stayed on the bench as the team secured a 1-1 to qualify for their third consecutive finals. But coach Sabri Lamouchi obviously saw enough of the talented youngster to give him a chance to earn his place in the World Cup squad. The 21-year-old Diomande, who can play as both a defensive or attacking midfielder, made his debut in the St Etienne side in early 2012 when he came on as a late substitute against Lille. He played only one other game that season and played just twice the following term. Although he featured in 15 games for his club in the 2013/4 season, the majority of those were as a late substitute, although he enjoyed a spell as a regular between late September and early December. It was during this time that he was called up for the game against Senegal. Diomande first played for the Elephants in the final friendly ahead of the squad announcement, when the West Africans lost 2-1 against Bosnia & Herzegovina."}, {"Max GRADEL": "Unlike many other C\u00f4te d'Ivoire players, Max Gradel, took his first steps in professional football in England, where he arrived as a teenager. He signed his first contract with Leicester City, going on loan to Bournemouth and Leeds United.  At the end of the loan period, Leeds United decided to sign Gradel, and he stayed at Elland Road until August 2011 when Ligue 1 team Saint Etienne brought him to France. Gradel has been with the club since then, playing regularly and drawing interest from larger European clubs. While still a Leeds player, the 26-year-old, who is extremely effective coming in off the wing and has an explosive pace and tricky dribbling skills, said that he had joined the club to boost his chances of making the Elephants' squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122. Although overlooked at the time, he was given a first call-up a few months later and has since been a regular feature in the team and made the squad for both the 2012 and 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations finals. He was called up four times in the World Cup qualifying campaign and played on each occasion and is now hoping to be given some match time in Brazil.

The midfielder has also tasted success on the global stage, when he was in the Barcelona side that won the FIFA Club World Cup in 2009, beating Argentinian club Estudiantes 2-1 in the final. Brazil 2014 will be the third FIFA World Cup that the younger of the three Toure brothers (Kolo Toure plays for Liverpool, while Ibrahim Toure plays for Lebanese club Al-Safa SC) will be appearing, and he is one of just four players to have featured in all six matches have played on the global stage in their history. Like his brother Kolo, Yaya got his first taste of European football at Beveren, a year after starting his professional career at 17 with ASEC Mimosas. He stayed in Belgium for two-and-a-half seasons, quickly becoming a first choice in the starting eleven. Then, in the winter transfer window, he left Beveren for Metalurg Donetsk, where he made regular first-team appearances for another season-and-a-half.  The summer of 2005 brought a further move, this time to Greece. And although his league form with Olympiakos was not outstanding, he conjured up some commanding performances in the Champions League. By the end of the season, he was a target for a number of clubs and finally opted for a move to Monaco. A successful season in France marked by five goals and as many assists in 27 games was followed by a dream transfer to Barcelona, where he spent three seasons before making a big-money move to his current club, Manchester City. Since then, he has cemented his reputation as one of the world's foremost midfielders and will surely be a key player in his team's Brazil 2014 campaign.

He moved to Tunisia from top C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire club Stade d\\'Abijan, but his stay in North Africa was short-lived as FC Sion lured him to the Swiss League, where he has been since 2008.  Twice a cup winner with Sion, the defensive midfielder joined Basel midway through the last season. He is known as an aggressive player who does not shy away from hard tackles. His Basel coach Murat Yakin said about him: \u201cHe is a player you would rather have in your side than play against.\" That playing style has, though, seen him pick up plenty of red cards, including four in a six-month period.  Serey was a relative late-comer to the national team as he was already 28 when he played his first match for the Elephants. He featured in four 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying matches \u2013 all victories \u2013 and is now hoping to get a first appearance at the World Cup finals under his belt, living up to the saying: better late than never.

The nephew of former Cameroon captain Rigobert Song, the midfielder has represented his country at the FIFA U-17 tournament in Finland in 2003, at the Olympic Football Tournament in 2008 and at the last FIFA World Cup\u2122 finals in South Africa. He was also ever-present in Cameroon\u2019s qualifying campaign, playing in all eight matches as the Indomitable Lions secured a second consecutive appearance on the global stage. But it is not only in international football that he has excelled since moving to France and joining SC Bastia at the age of 16. After breaking through into the first team, he was allowed to move to Arsenal for a season on loan and although he did not feature in many games, the Gunners convinced Bastia to sell him to them. Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger decided to switch Song to a new position, slotting him into a holding role in midfield, one in which he could give full expression to his talent, mopping up loose balls and launching attacks from deep. Song repaid Wenger for his confidence with exceptional performances for the Gunners and in seven seasons in England he played 150 Premier League games. He moved to Spanish giants Barcelona in 2012 and has been with the Catalan club since then.

He was also in the Cameroon squad at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122, and he played four matches in the qualifiers for Brazil. He also has the experience of having been in the Cameroon squad at the 2008 and 2010 CAF Africa Cup of Nations tournaments. Serving his apprenticeship with Nancy, the diminutive N\u2019Guemo quickly adapted to life in Ligue 1, enjoying several first-team outings before turning 20 and also running out in the UEFA Cup. At the end of the 2008/09 season, during which he played 33 league games for Nancy and five UEFA Cup matches, he signed for\\xa0Celtic on loan.

As a battling competitor who also boasts a good motor and technical skills, he makes an excellent link between defence and attack. And despite his relatively small size, his headed goals from set-pieces are another specialty for the athletic player. Makoun was spotted in 1999 during the CAF African U-17 Championship in Guinea by the former Cameroon keeper Joseph-Antoine Bell, who suggested he should try out for some French sides. He signed with Lille and made a name there for many seasons before moving to Lyon in 2008. Despite a strong start to life there, things did not end well after three years and so he moved on to Aston Villa, who sent him on loan to Olympiacos and Rennes. He has since joined the French club on a permanent move and his confidence has grown as he gets regular game time.

The defensive midfielder played 29 league games for Queens Park Rangers, but could not help the club avoid relegation at the end of that season, so he joined Sevilla on loan at the start of last term. A consummate professional, Mbia has not succumbed to the materialism that many players fall for, instead remembering his roots, saying in an interview: \u201cSome footballers might not realise what's going on around them, but there are others like me who know they're privileged and lucky to be living this life.\u201d Mbia played in the FIFA U-17 World Cup Finland 2003 and scored his side's equalising goal four minutes into injury time in their dramatic 5-5 draw against Portugal, where the African side came back from five goals down. He moved on from the U-17s to play for the senior side and also represented his country at the Men's Olympic Football Tournament Beijing 2008. Mbia has become a vital player in the heart of Cameroon's side, playing seven times for the Indomitable Lions in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifiers to add to the 10 preliminary games he played en route to South Africa 2010, where he also featured in all three\\xa0contests at the finals.

He also played on the island of Cyprus for Magusa Turk Gucu and Turk Ocagi Limasol, in South Africa for Ajax Cape Town and in the English Premier League, where he spent a loan period with Fulham. He started his professional career with local club Mount Cameroon. Enoh is a physically strong player, who is prone to robust play, which at times can get him into disciplinary trouble. He started his international career in 2009 and has since played a consistent role in the Cameroon national team. He was included in the squad for the CAF Africa Cup of Nations in 2010, as well as that year's FIFA World Cup\u2122, and played an important part in helping the Indomitable Lions secure appearances at consecutive World Cups.

Salli joined Monaco in July 2011, signing a three-year contract. He played regularly in his first season in France, scoring a number of goals in the process. As the club received a huge cash boost from an investment group at the end of the year, several big-name players including Radamel Falcao and Eric Abidal were signed by the club. Salli found his opportunities to play first-team football severely curtailed as the club made a successful bid for promotion back into Ligue 1. He spent most of his time playing for the reserves and was loaned to second tier team Lens for the 2013/14 season.

He was not intimidated by the best footballers in the world as the opposition in his first Bundesliga match were Bayern in Munich's Allianz Arena. At the end of the 90 minutes people were talking about the teenager who had shown not one ounce of nervousness, and in fact took the game to Bayern. He scored the equaliser in a 1-1 draw and was named the man of the match. It was to be the start of an ongoing relationship with ambitious Bundesliga club Schalke, who have been impressively consistent in the league and again qualified for the UEFA Champions League this past term. Matip's reputation and value has risen at the same rate, and he is consistently linked with moves to the biggest European clubs.\\r\\nNeedless to say, Matip was a player that the Germans were keen to have for their national youth teams, but the youngster decided that he would rather follow in his brother Marvin's footsteps, who had opted to play for his father's country after earlier representing Germany at the FIFA U-20 World Cup. Joel was included in Paul Le Guen's squad for the CAF Africa Cup of Nations 2010, but he delayed his international debut until a friendly\\xa0against Italy.

To cap it all, he can also strike the ball well with both feet. It comes as no surprise, then, that the midfielder has been an ever-present in the national side since winning his first cap in 2007, taking part in the qualifying competition for South Africa 2010 and also playing a leading role in the Brazil 2014 preliminaries, appearing in 12 games in all, nine of them from the start. A graduate of the football academy run by former player Alexis Garcia in Medellin, he has played all his club football outside Colombia, leaving for Uruguay at the age of 17 to play for Danubio and then River Plate, and going on to join French side Valenciennes in 2007.

He is also a set-piece expert, provides plenty of assists and knows where the back of the net is, as he showed by finishing third-highest scorer for his side with three goals en route to Brazil. James\u2019s footballing career can only be defined as precocious.

Though he started out as a striker, he has latterly been playing in midfield, even reverting to right wing-back on occasion. After enduring a tough upbringing and growth problems that almost brought his career to a halt before it had even started, Cuadrado made his debut with Independiente de Medellin in 2008. A year later, at the age of only 21, he made the move to Serie A, and while spells with Udinese and Lecce proved luckless, his arrival at Fiorentina changed everything. He is now rightly regarded as one of   most prized possessions. His first cap for Colombia came in 2010, and since the arrival of Jose Pekerman the midfielder has become a regular fixture in the side, thanks in the main to his explosive ability and versatility, both of which are highly appreciated by the Argentinian.

In making a meteoric start to his career, Guarin represented his country at the FIFA U-17 World Cup in August 2003, not long after turning 17, and three months later formed part of the Colombia squad that took third place at the U-20 world finals. On his return home, Envigado offered him his first professional contract, and after distinguishing himself at the FIFA U-20 World Cup Netherlands 2005, the young midfielder from Puerto Boyaca packed his bags for Argentina and Boca Juniors. From there he would depart for Europe, enjoying spells with Saint Etienne and Porto, where he won the UEFA Europa League and a host of other trophies alongside compatriot Radamel Falcao, before joining current employers Inter Milan. A creative midfielder, Guarin has excelled wherever he has gone, both in the centre and out on the right. Though blessed with excellent vision and playmaking and passing skills, perhaps his strongest suit is his shooting with either foot. Naturally right-footed, he can strike the ball just as well with his left. First capped in 2006, he took part in the South Africa 2010 preliminaries and gained further experience at the 2011 Copa America before taking on the challenge of helping Colombia return to the world finals for the first time in 16 years. After featuring in nine qualifiers on the road to Brazil 2014, Guarin is now focused on the task of taking  into the world elite, just as he did in his youth days.

A product of the youth system at Envigado, Quintero needed only a season at Atletico Nacional to attract interest from clubs in Europe. So it was no surprise when Serie A side Pescara came calling in 2012. Once in Italy, the Medellin-born midfielder quickly showed his quality on the ball, excellent vision and his superb left foot, which was especially lethal from free-kicks.  Porto soon swooped and the Portuguese side confirmed his signing after the FIFA U-20 World Cup Turkey 2013 in which Quintero impressed and netted the competition\u2019s best goal, even though Colombia failed to make it beyond the last 16. Months earlier, the youngster had led  to victory in the South American championship at the same age group and also made his senior debut for his country in a friendly against Cameroon. Ever since then, this prodigious talent has been a regular in Jose Pekerman\u2019s squads and the midfielder featured in the team's qualifiers en route to Brazil 2014.

While Borges has traditionally patrolled the midfield, he is not afraid to get forward into the attack and chip in his fair share of goals.

The current Copenhagen stalwart has seen action in several FIFA competitions on many levels, including the FIFA U-17 World Cup Trinidad and Tobago 2001 where the young midfielder first cut his teeth on the international stage. When he was at Saprissa, the club where he began his career in 2001, Bolanos competed at the FIFA Club World Cup Japan 2005 and was awarded the Bronze Ball as the tournament\u2019s third best player. Bolanos earned his first cap for  senior side that same year and subsequently helped the Central American team qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany\u2122. He appeared in two group stage matches, losses at the hands of Poland and Germany, but the experience Bolanos earned there would prove useful in the next two World Cup qualifying campaigns. While  failed to reach South Africa 2010 after dropping the intercontinental play-off to Uruguay, Bolanos featured in nine of his country\u2019s qualfiers, only to then make an impact in 12 of Costa Rica\u2019s Brazil 2014 qualifiers, which ended with them finishing second in CONCACAF\u2019s .\\xa0 "}, {"Michael BARRANTES": "Michael Barrantes is a highly lauded midfielder who holds a coveted and well-deserved place on coach Jorge Luis Pinto\u2019s FIFA World Cup\u2122 squad, and the stage is set for the talented midfielder to shine for Costa Rica at Brazil 2014. After a youth career spent with Ramonese, Barrantes began his professional career in 2004 with Belen but he rose to prominence with Saprissa when he signed with the Costa Rican giants in 2007. After an impressive set of performances during Saprissa\u2019s European tour, Barrantes was signed by Norwegian side Aalesund FK and quickly became a favourite among his team-mates and coaches. After a season of adjusting to the European leagues, Barrantes started the 2011 season with a bang. The popular midfielder was named Man of the Match for four consecutive games with Aalesund FK and a local newspaper crowned him 'king of the midfield'. Barrantes is approaching the half-century mark of Costa Rica appearances, scoring four goals along the way for his native country. Most recently, he put two in the net for Costa Rica against Cuba in the 2012 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Despite missing out on action in Germany 2006, Barrantes picked up some experience in narrowly failed bid to reach South Africa 2010, featuring in four matches for the Central American country. More recently, Barrantes appeared in ten Brazil 2014 qualifiers, setting him up to fit well into Pinto\u2019s plans. "}, {"Oscar GRANADOS": "Oscar Esteban Granados began his football career with Costa Rican club Cartagines, where he played from 2003 until 2011. After more than seven years with the club, Granados moved to Orion. He brought his strong playing skills to Herdiano in 2012, where he remains. In addition to his time with several Costa Rican clubs, Granados represented his country successfully in the 2009 UNCAF Copa and the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup as well as an elimination game for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122. With only a handful of caps for the senior squad, it seems unlikely Granados will make much of an impact in coach Jorge Luis Pinto\u2019s side at Brazil 2014. However, the tenacious defensive midfielder will push other fringe players in the 23-man squad and will certainly jump at any opportunity to help his country compete in what is expected to be a very difficult Group D. "}, {"Yeltsin TEJEDA": "Yeltsin Tejeda is one of the youngest members of Jorge Luis Pinto\u2019s squad headed to Brazil, but he is also a very promising talent. Since making his professional debut in 2011, the 22-year old midfielder has only played for Costa Rican giants Saprissa and has helped the club to\\xa0several titles in recent years. Though only standing 5ft 9ins, Tejeda comfortably executes his holding defensive midfield duties with composure rare in players his age. While performing admirably for Saprissa both in the youth ranks and now for the first team, Tejeda also made an early splash on the international stage, appearing in the Costa Rican side at the 2009 CONCACAF U-17 Championship and in the U-20 edition of the tournament two years later. Tejeda earned his first senior cap against Cuba after his impressive showing at the CONCACAF U-20 Championship in December 2011. Since then he has served Jorge Luis Pinto well, coming on as substitute on several occasions and even starting an occasional match. Tejeda was almost always on the 18-man roster during qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, and he made a total of six appearances during the . Tejeda will likely fill a similar role for  at Brazil 2014. "}, {"Diego CALVO": "While he has only been a recent entrant into coach Jorge Luis Pinto\u2019s Costa Rica side, Diego Calvo will be expected to do some of the heavy lifting in  midfield, providing bursts of energy and clever skill on the wings to strike during counter attacks if the central American side is looking to advance out of a tricky Group D at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122.\\xa0 Having started his professional career at Alajuelense in 2010, where he managed five goals in three seasons for the Costa Rican giants, Calvo impressed quickly and made an impact at the FIFA U-20 World Cup Colombia 2011, featuring in Costa Rica\u2019s three group-stage matches. Calvo now plies his trade in Norway for Valerenga, where he linked up with fellow countryman and team-mate Giancarlo Gonzalez for a short while. He has played predominantly on the left side of midfield, but is equally adept at playing on the right. Impressed by his play in Europe, Pinto called Calvo into his squad during the final round of CONCACAF World Cup qualifying and gave him his cap in a snowy encounter against USA in Denver on 22 March 2013. The midfielder featured another five times for Pinto during qualifying, helping  seal an impressive second place finish just behind the Americans and found his way onto the scoresheet against Jamaica in the process. Though he lacks the international experience some of his team-mates possess, Calvo looks primed to contribute for Costa Rica in Brazil, and could be relied upon heavily by Pinto. "}, {"Jose CUBERO": "Having already earned over a quarter-century of appearances for  in a relatively short career so far with his national team, Jose Cubero has been establishing himself as a consistent and reliable option for coach Jorge Luis Pinto in the midfield, particularly covering any defensive responsibilities in front of the backline. An Alajuela native, Cubero made his professional debut with Herediano in 2009. The 27-year old midfielder was sent out on a year-long loan to Puntarenas only six months into his time with Herediano, but ever since his return to Costa Rica\u2019s oldest club in July of 2010, Cubero has excelled and signed a three-year extension to stay with the team back in 2013. Though he earned his first cap in 2010, Cubero\u2019s impact in Jorge Luis Pinto\u2019s side only became consistent recently, appearing in nine of Costa Rica\u2019s 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifiers in CONCACAF\u2019s  en route to an impressive second place finish. Cubero will likely serve an invaluable role in coming off the bench to give  an important sense of calm and defensive mentality in the final minutes of a match. "}, {"Ivan PERISIC": "Ivan Perisic was a key part of Croatia\u2019s 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying campaign, appearing in ten of their 12 matches (including the play-offs). This summer\u2019s tournament will be the second major competition in which the 25-year-old has featured, following on from UEFA EURO 2012. Despite his young age, Perisic has already played club football in four countries. At the age of 17, he left his hometown side Hadjuk Split for France before moving on to Belgium three years later. He enjoyed his breakthrough season at Club Brugge in 2009/10 and was the league\u2019s leading goalscorer in 2010/11. This success garnered the attention of Borussia Dortmund, who signed the attacking midfielder in 2011. After winning the double in 2012 before facing a more frustrating start to the 2012/13 season, he transferred to fellow Bundesliga challengers VfL Wolfsburg, where he steadily regained his previous form. \u201cHe can play in several attacking positions, both on the wing and in the centre,\u201d said his club coach Dieter Hecking in praise of Perisic. His style of play means he is often compared with former German international star Michael Ballack. "}, {"Ivan RAKITIC": "At 26, Ivan Rakitic may still have his best years ahead of him as a footballer, but even so the midfielder has already developed into one of his country\u2019s most reliable performers. His transfer from Schalke 04 to FC Sevilla in 2011 was a bold but justified move \u2013 in the meantime he has been appointed captain of the club and rumours of interest from several of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs persist. Prior to his move to Spain, Rakitic rarely showed his full potential with FC Basel and later Schalke. That has all changed now, however, much to the benefit of his national team. Together with Luka Modric, another gifted playmaker who can change a game in an instant, he forms one of the most impressive midfields on the international scene. Rakitic appeared in ten qualification matches on the road to Brazil 2014 \u2013 only four players in the squad managed more. He also played ten times in qualifying for South Africa 2010 and travelled to the 2008 and 2012 UEFA EUROs. With over 60 caps to his name already, he will be one of Croatia\u2019s most experienced players in South America despite his tender years. Born in Mohlin, Rakitic could have played for Switzerland and even represented the  at youth level. However, he ultimately opted to play for the nation of his parents \u2013 and the decision has clearly paid off. "}, {"Ognjen VUKOJEVIC": "Ognjen Vukojevic\u2019s international breakthrough came in the summer of 2008 when he signed for Ukrainian giants Dynamo Kiev and earned a place in Croatia\u2019s squad for UEFA EURO 2008. His form leading up to the tournament had been highly impressive as he helped Dinamo Zagreb to a domestic double and since then he has been an integral part of the national side, appearing in 15 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualification matches since his debut in October 2007. \\r\\nVukojevic left his homeland aged 20 for Belgian club Lierse SK, but returned just a few months later after struggling to establish himself. He developed into a key player with Dinamo Zagreb before his switch to Ukraine, where the 30-year-old won the title in his first season. He also played in all six of Kiev\u2019s UEFA Champions League group stage fixtures and netted two crucial goals in his side\u2019s run to the UEFA Europa League semi-finals. "}, {"Luka MODRIC": "Luka Modric is the undisputed superstar of the Croatian national team, with an impressive career to date in two of Europe\u2019s top leagues. In 2008, the midfielder moved from Dinamo Zagreb to English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for around \u20ac25m and quickly established himself as an indispensable part of the team. Sir Alex Ferguson, then Manchester United manager, even once described him as the best player in the league. But the diminutive footballing wizard\u2019s journey was not over yet. After four years, he left England behind to join Spanish giants Real Madrid for \u20ac35m and,\\xa0after some initial teething problems, has gone on to secure a starting place in a star-studded team. Modric has played for his country at both the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA EURO 2008 and 2012, having made his international debut against Argentina in March 2006. However, EURO 2008 provided painful memories for the 28-year-old, who provided the assist to give Croatia a 1-0 lead against Turkey in the quarter-final before missing the first penalty in the eventual shoot-out. His current club coach, Carlo Ancelotti, holds his player in the highest regard, saying: \u201cLuka is an exceptional player. I think he\u2019s one of the best midfielders in the world right now, because he can play in more than one position.\u201d "}, {"Marcelo BROZOVIC": "It may be the taking part in 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 that counts most for Marcelo Brozovic, a 21-year-old who has been a fixture of Croatia teams at youth level, making over 20 appearances, but is yet to represent his country\u2019s senior team. He faces stiff competition from the likes of Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic and Sammir for a place in central midfield at Brazil 2014, meaning that he will likely be restricted to a substitute\u2019s role. Yet even that will represent a major success for a player with no experience of senior international football. Brozovic plays his club football at Dinamo Zagreb, whom he joined in 2012 on a seven-year contract, following spells at Lokomotiva Zagreb and his hometown outfit Hrvatski Dragovoljac. The popular feeling back home is that he has massive potential, and might just be one of the big surprises at the showpiece finals in Brazil. "}, {"Milan BADELJ": "Milan Badelj is one of the many Croatian internationals to have been schooled in the Dinamo Zagreb youth system. The 25-year-old was named as the Croatian top flight\u2019s Young Player of the Year in 2009 and won four league championships and a trio of a cup titles between 2009 and 2012, before moving to the Bundesliga with Hamburg in summer later that year. \u201cHe\u2019s a playmaker but not a classic No10,\u201d said Frank Arnesen, Hamburg\u2019s sporting director at the time. \u201cHe controls the game from deep, is an intelligent player and is a very good passer.\u201d After a difficult teething period, Badelj has now settled in and is eager to showcase his talents in Brazil too. However, given the intense competition for places in Croatia\u2019s midfield, the \u201cdiamond from Zagreb\u201d, as the country\u2019s media have dubbed him, will not have it easy. Badelj only featured three times during 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying, although he finished on the winning team each time. "}, {"SAMMIR": "For any footballer, playing in the opening game of a FIFA World Cup\u2122 against the host nation is a special experience indeed. For Jorge Sammir Cruz Campos or \u2018Sammir\u2019, however, it will be a truly unique moment. The midfielder was born in April 1987 in Brazil, lived there until he was 19 and spent his teen years at Atletico Mineiro and Atletico Paranaense, also representing his country at youth team level. However, since embarking on a European adventure and joining Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb in 2007, his career has taken a very different path. Sammir quickly established himself as a key player in the Croatian capital, helping Dinamo to a staggering 14 trophies in eight years, and in 2013 he was named the league\u2019s best player before he left the club for pastures new in January 2014, signing for Spanish Primera club Getafe CF. Plying his trade in Europe meant he fell off the Brazilian national team selectors\u2019 radar, but Sammir simply sought a different route to the top. In 2012 he was granted Croatian citizenship and in October of that year he made his full international debut for the  against FYR Macedonia, appearing three times in total as Croatia qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122. The 27-year-old may end up being the team\u2019s super sub in Brazil, since world-class midfielders Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic are likely to start for the team. Nevertheless, Sammir will surely be given a chance to shine in the country of his birth. He has a clever eye for a pass, is composed in possession and an accomplished assist-maker, making him an ideal candidate for a play-making role. He also has an impressive record of scoring goals himself and will be a asset for coach Niko Kovac no matter when he is introduced. "}, {"Mateo KOVACIC": "Aside from Alen Halilovic, 20-year-old Mateo Kovacic is arguably Croatian football\u2019s most promising young player and has already drawn comparisons with Real Madrid star Luka Modric. Born in 1994 and raised in Austria, the attacking midfielder returned to Zagreb with his family in 2007.  He made his professional debut at Dinamo Zagreb, grabbing his first senior goals in 2010 at the age of just 16, thereby becoming the youngest goalscorer in the club\u2019s history - though his record was soon surpassed by team-mate Halilovic. Kovacic has also won two league championship medals with Dinamo. \\r\\nIn 2013, he fulfilled the dream of a lifetime by signing for Italian giants Inter Milan. \u201cInter won many titles when I was still a young boy. It\u2019s unbelievable to be signing for such a great club. I can\u2019t describe my feelings now,\u201d said the young prodigy at the time. Despite his tender age, Kovacic made six appearances for Croatia during the \u2019s most recent FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying campaign. It is surely only a matter of time before he becomes a regular for the national side. "}, {"Alex IBARRA": "Alex Ibarra is one of Ecuadorian football\u2019s outstanding young players from the last few years. Talented, agile, fast and unpredictable with his dribbling, this attacking right midfielder is an exciting player who can assist and score goals either running with the ball or from long distance. Born in Ambuqui, Ibarra made his debut at El Nacional, where he soon stood out due to his extraordinary technical ability. His impressive performances in Ecuador caught the attention of Dutch side Vitesse and the midfielder is now not only a starter in the Netherlands, but a popular player among the club\u2019s fans as well. His international career began in the youth teams and he was one of the stars of the South American U-20\\xa0Championship in 2011, only missing out on a World Cup appearance at that level due to an injury suffered just before the tournament in Colombia. That same year, however, he made his debut for the senior side in a friendly against Argentina in Mar del Plata.

"}, {"Cristhian NOBOA": "Christian Noboa is the man charged with ensuring balance in the Ecuadorian midfield, his extraordinary technique, defensive solidity, tactical intelligence and outstanding passing ability making him an essential cog in  machine at the 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122. Known as(The Tsar) in his homeland, Noboa made his breakthrough at the age of 19 at Emelec, wasting little time nailing down a starting berth and helping the club to a runners-up finish in the domestic championship. Snapped up by Russian outfit Rubin Kazan, he continued to demonstrate his abundant qualities, growing into an important part of the side that claimed the club\u2019s first ever national title. More success followed at Rubin in the shape of another title and a Russian Supercup, honours that have since earned him a switch to Dinamo Moscow \u2013 where he continues to catch the eye. Regarding the national-team set-up, Noboa began at youth level as part of the squad that participated in the U-20 Sudamericano in Colombia in 2005. The following year he was called up for two friendlies with Ecuador\u2019s senior squad, though he failed to see action and was not selected for the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122. His senior debut eventually came in 2009 during qualifying for South Africa 2010, making seven appearances and scoring two goals \u2013 one of which was a memorable late equaliser against Brazil. Also part of  squad at the Copa America in Argentina in 2011, Noboa has really come into his own in Brazil 2014 qualifying.

"}, {"Jefferson MONTERO": "Exceptionally gifted, an elusive dribbler and able to beat his man on either side, Jefferson Montero is one of the biggest names in the Ecuadorian game. Ally those qualities with his speed on the ball and finishing ability, and the 24-year-old is most definitely a forward to be feared. The Babahoyo-born attacker has already racked up plenty of miles on his club career trail, starting out at Emelec and then going out on loan to Independiente del Valle \u2013 who at the time played in Ecuador\u2019s second tier. A subsequent spell at Mexico\u2019s Dorados followed before returning to Independiente, whereupon he was snapped up by Spanish side Villarreal, for whom he started out in their B team to help the adaptation process. Montero\u2019s impressive displays saw him brought into the first-team squad at , though it was not long before he was sent out on loan to first Levante and then Real Betis. Eventually he found himself back in Mexico with Monarcas, where he has grown into an automatic starter and key performer. At national-team level, he was among the main men as  won gold at the 2007 Pan-American Games, scoring in the final win over Jamaica. Montero also shone at the U-20 Sudamericano in 2009, cementing his reputation among his country\u2019s biggest rising stars. The fleet-footed forward made his senior international debut in 2007, appearing in seven 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifiers and finding the net once. And it was during the Brazil 2014 qualifying phase that he definitively cemented his place as a fixture for coach Reinaldo Rueda,  playing 13 times and grabbed three goals \u2013 including the winner against Uruguay in Quito which clinched qualification for Ecuador.

After shining at first club Deportivo Quito and then El Nacional, Mendez moved to Mexico with Irapuato and Santos Laguna. A title-winning season back home with Liga de Quito was the springboard for a subsequent switch to PSV, where he twice lifted the Eredevisie, before he tasted Copa Sudamericana glory back in Quito. The midfield schemer, who currently plies his trade for Colombian side Santa Fe, has also had spells at Atletico Mineiro and Emelec. Nicknamed , Mendez has been lighting up the Ecuadorian international scene since 2000, appearing at four straight Copa Americas and a CONCACAF Golf Cup. However, his undoubted highlight came after guiding Ecuador to their first-ever FIFA World Cup\u2122, at Korea/Japan 2002, and their maiden victory at the competition, secured through his winner against Croatia. Four years later, following another successful qualifying campaign, Mendez and his teammates reached the Round of 16 at Germany 2006.

He currently continues to ply his trade in Mexico as a first-team regular for Pachuca.  An international veteran, Ayovi made his senior Ecuador debut all the way back in 2001. He went on to appear in that year's Copa America, one of three editions of the competition he has featured in, and was also an unused member of his country's squad at the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan.

The Liverpool midfielder now has over 100 caps and is his country\u2019s captain. His international bow, on 31 May 2000 against Ukraine, came shortly before UEFA EURO 2000, where Gerrard had a fleeting taste of the action as a substitute in the 1-0 win over Germany.  It was in his next appearance against the Germans, in a FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifier in Munich in September 2001 that the Liverpudlian underlined his prodigious talent with a typically spectacular first goal for his country. With the sides level at 1-1 approaching half-time, Gerrard unleashed a rocket shot past Oliver Kahn, sending England on their way to a remarkable 5-1 success.  Unfortunately for Gerrard he missed the subsequent 2002 finals through injury so instead had to wait until UEFA EURO 2004 for his first chance to really make his mark on a major tournament. He had captained his country for the first time against Sweden shortly before those finals and in Portugal was an ever present, scoring in a 3-0 group-stage win over Switzerland.  A one-club man, Gerrard resisted Chelsea\u2019s overtures that same summer and was rewarded with arguably the greatest moment of his career in 2004/05, when he played a crucial role in Liverpool\u2019s unlikely UEFA Champions League triumph. It took an explosive, late strike from Gerrard against Olympiacos in December 2004 just to prolong Liverpool\u2019s interest beyond the group stage. Five months later he played a prominent role in a stunning comeback in the Istanbul final against AC Milan, heading the first goal as Liverpool retrieved a 3-0 deficit before prevailing on penalties.  Gerrard \u2013 third in the Ballon D\u2019Or vote in 2005 \u2013 further enhanced his status as Liverpool\u2019s Captain Fantastic with another heroic strike in the 2006 FA Cup final against West Ham United, firing in an improbable injury-time volley from over 30 yards to salvage a 3-3 draw and set up another shootout success.  His scoring rate soaring, Gerrard found the net 22 times for Liverpool that season, earning the PFA Player of the Year award. He took that form into the FIFA World Cup in Germany, netting in group games against Trinidad and Tobago and Sweden but, unfortunately, was one of three players foiled by Portugal goalkeeper Ricardo when England succumbed in another shoot-out in the quarter-finals.  A dynamic, driving presence in midfield, Gerrard, captained his country during the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals in South Africa before helping England qualify for UEFA EURO 2012 in which they reach the Round of 16 and quarter-finals respectively.

Ten days later he scored against Sheffield United in the League Cup and in November of the same year he became only the fifth 16-year-old in history to play in the UEFA Champions League.  Wilshere had appeared for England\u2019s U-16s, U-17s and U-19s before Stuart Pearce gave him his U-21 debut as a substitute for Fabian Delph in the friendly with Holland in Groningen on 11 August 2009, when he was just 17. Exactly a year later Wilshere made his senior bow in a 2-1 friendly victory over Hungary at Wembley.  He has earned a number of accolades including the PFA Young Player of the Year award, nomination to the 2010/11 PFA Team of the Year, and Arsenal\\'s Player of the Season award, as voted for by fans for his performances in his first full campaign for Arsenal during the 2010/11 season.  Wilshere missed UEFA EURO 2012 due to injury, but has since returned to play a key role for Roy Hodgson\u2019s side. The midfielder has stated his ambition to captain both Arsenal and England and has been tipped by Arsene Wenger for both roles.  England manager Roy Hodgson said: \"Wilshere has got the personality, the character and the quality to accept responsibility, to accept the pressure. I foresee a fantastic England career for him.

He established a record of 164 successive appearances in the Premier League between 2001 and 2005 and is now Chelsea\u2019s all-time leading scorer.  There is no secret to Lampard\u2019s success. He owes his fitness levels to years of hard work that began in boyhood, when his father, former West Ham United defender Frank Lampard Sr. taught him the habit of extra running sessions, or \u2018spikes\u2019, each day to improve his speed and stamina.  It was with West Ham that Lampard began his professional career, under the tutelage of his uncle Harry Redknapp, then manager of the east London club. After 187 appearances at Upton Park, he joined Chelsea in June 2001.  Lampard had made his England debut in 1999 but it was not until the 2003/04 campaign that he truly found his feet on the international stage. The Londoner began that season with his first goal for his country in a friendly win over Croatia and he ended it with three in four games at UEFA EURO 2004, where England reached the quarter-finals.  At 26, he was entering his prime. He hit 19 goals for Chelsea in 2004/05 to help them to their first English title for half a century and ended 2005 second only to Ronaldinho in the vote for FIFA World Player of the Year. A further Premier League success followed in 2005/06.  Lampard played for England at South Africa 2010 famously 'scoring' a goal against Germany that clearly crossed the line but was not awarded. That season he had helped Chelsea to an FA Cup and Premier League 'double' and since then he has continued to star for the Blues, guiding them to FA Cup and UEFA Champions League success in 2012. However, he was ruled out of EURO 2012 with a thigh injury.  On 10 September 2013, he became only the third English player to reach his 100th England cap in a FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifier with Ukraine.

In the build-up to the Finals, Jordan made his England senior team debut against France at Wembley in November 2010, playing alongside Steven Gerrard from the start. That partnership was soon replicated at club level with the midfielder joining Liverpool from Sunderland shortly before the UEFA U-21 EUROs in Denmark.  Henderson was named as a standby player in Roy Hodgson's UEFA EURO 2012 squad and came into the squad following an injury to Frank Lampard. He featured in two games: against France and Italy both as a substitute.  On 3 February 2013, Henderson was named the England U-21 Player of the Year in the inaugural year of the award. He also captained the U-21 side at the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship.  In November 2013, he played for England for the first time since Euro 2012 with substitute appearances in friendly matches against Chile and Germany. He made his second start for the national team in a 1\u20130 defeat of Denmark on 5 March 2014.  "}, {"Alex OXLADE CHAMBERLAIN": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is a lively forward who rose to prominence with Southampton in 2010, earning a call-up to the England U-18 side in the process.  His continued good form for the Saints alerted the interest of Arsenal and he joined the Gunners in the summer of 2011 having already been fast-tracked into Stuart Pearce\u2019s U-21 squad by that stage.  Nicknamed \u2018The Ox\u2019, derived from the first part of his surname, as well as his physical tenacity and powerful playing style, Oxlade-Chamberlain is the youngest English goalscorer in UEFA Champions League history.  He made his debut for the senior England side on 26 May 2012 in a 1\u20130 win against Norway in a friendly. Following this, he received a surprise call-up to the England squad for UEFA EURO 2012, becoming the second youngest player ever to represent England in the European Championships behind Wayne Rooney when he started in England's opening game against France.  Oxlade-Chamberlain scored his first senior international goal, in a 5-0 victory over San Marino in October 2012. He scored again in the return match against San Marino in March last year, which England won 8-0. He also scored against Brazil in the official opening of the refurbished Maracana in a 2-2 draw.  There is international history in Alex's family too, as his father Mark Chamberlain played for England eight times in the 1980s as well as for the Under-21s.  "}, {"James MILNER": "James Milner made an immediate impact on the Premier League when he was just 16, becoming one of its youngest-ever players and goalscorers while breaking through the ranks at his hometown club, Leeds United.  He made 48 appearances for the Yorkshire club before moving to Newcastle United in July 2004 and Aston Villa for a fee of \u00a312m four years later. It was at Villa where he made his senior debut for England, coming on as a substitute for Ashley Young in a friendly against the Netherlands in Amsterdam in 2009.  Prior to his full debut, Milner had represented England at U-16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and U-21 levels, appearing in UEFA European U-21 Championship finals. The midfielder also holds the record number of appearances (46) with England\u2019s U-21 side.  After impressing Fabio Capello, Milner was included in the Three Lions\u2019 squad for South Africa 2010, setting up the only goal of the game in their win over Slovenia. Milner also played in six matches during qualifying for UEFA EURO 2012, and was named in Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad for the tournament.  After that FIFA World Cup\u2122, Manchester City reportedly paid \u00a328.5m for his services and he has completed the domestic treble of winning the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup at the Etihad Stadium.  Despite claiming over 40 caps for England, Milner has scored just once for his country in a 5-0 away win to Moldova during the qualifiers for Brazil 2014.  "}, {"Raheem STERLING": "Despite being born in Kingston, Jamaica, Raheem Sterling grew up and went to school just a goal-kick's distance from Wembley Stadium. He joined Liverpool from Queens Park Rangers in 2010 whilst still in his mid-teens in a deal which could rise to \u00a35m.  He helped John Peacock's Young Lions to qualify for the European Championship Finals in Serbia, where England reached the semi-final and then took part in the FIFA U-17 World Cup in Mexico in the summer of 2011, where he netted a stunning goal against Rwanda.  Sterling continued to develop at Anfield and was called up to the England U-19 squad by Noel Blake at the start of the 2012/13 campaign, following some impressive early season performances in the Liverpool first-team.  Less than a week after his debut for the U-19s against Germany in September 2012, he was propelled into the senior squad by Roy Hodgson for the match against Ukraine at Wembley as a replacement for Theo Walcott.  With more appearances for Liverpool under his belt, Hodgson gave Sterling a full England debut in November 2012 when he started against Sweden in Stockholm and he has remained on the radar ever since, whilst still impressing with his performances for Gareth Southgate's U-21 side.  "}, {"Adam LALLANA": "Adam Lallana received his first senior call-up in September 2012, after his good form for Southampton in the Premier League had caught the eye of Roy Hodgson.  Previously capped at U-18, U-19 and Under-21 level, Lallana is a product of the Southampton youth academy and has been a regular in the Saints' first team for a number of years, playing a crucial role in their revival from League One back to the Premier League under Nigel Adkins.  He was brought into the squad to face Ukraine in a FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifier at Wembley following the withdrawal of a number of players from the initial squad.  Lallana won his first cap for England on 15 November in a friendly match against Chile at Wembley Stadium and claimed his first assist in the March friendly against Denmark when he set up the only goal of the game for Daniel Sturridge.  Following a good season for his club side, the midfielder was named as one of the six players on the shortlist for the PFA Player of the Year Award.  The boyhood Everton fan was due to be married on the day England played Italy in Manaus, but moved his wedding to Christmas Eve 2013 to avoid any potential clash.  "}, {"Ross BARKLEY": "Everton midfielder Ross Barkley is a strong and skillful player and has represented England at every stage from U-16 to senior level.  He was selected to play in the 2009 Montaigu Tournament and captained the team to success, beating Germany 2\u20131 on penalties in the final. He also helped England win the 2010 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship with two goals en route to the final where England beat Spain 2-1.  After a 2012/13 campaign which saw him have loan spells with Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United before returning to Everton to feature in the Premier League, he was picked for the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Turkey in June 2013. His performances in the tournament led coach Peter Taylor to label him as \u2018world class\u2019.  Taking that form into the 2013/14 season, Barkley scored his first competitive club goal in the 2-2 draw at Norwich City on the opening day, days after getting on the scoresheet for England Under-21s in the 6-0 thrashing of Scotland.

That is not a status he has particularly revelled in, given his shy nature off the pitch. Once he enters the field of play, however, Iniesta is able to leave those inhibitions behind and unleash an astonishing talent for finding eye-of-the-needle passes, evading even the tightest of markers and testing a goalkeeper\u2019s reflexes from any angle.  Though not a prolific goalscorer, he has shown a knack for popping up with crucial strikes, such as the aforementioned one in Johannesburg, for both club and country.

And yet, he originally had no nationality to speak of, due to his being born at sea in a boat full of refugees \u2013 including his Angolan mother and Zairian father Ricky Mavuba, a midfielder who represented his country at West Germany 1974 \u2013 fleeing the Angolan Civil War in 1984. Consequently, he grew up in France as a stateless individual, only acquiring French nationality at the age of 20, the same year he made his professional debut. Having come through the ranks at Bordeaux, the tough-tackling midfielder was promoted to the senior side and spent three seasons at Stade Chaban-Delmas. Following a brief spell at Spanish outfit Villarreal, where he made just five appearances, Mavuba signed for Lille in 2008, and captained  to a stunning French League and Cup double in 2011. Raymond Domenech was the first to call on his services at international level, bringing him on board for \u2019 qualifying campaign for Germany 2006. However, despite performing consistently for his club, he was unable to convince Domenech or his successor, Laurent Blanc, to make him a regular fixture in the team. Since the arrival of Didier Deschamps at the helm, he has benefitted from more frequent call-ups, and will be eager to repay his coach\u2019s loyalty in Brazil. "}, {"Blaise MATUIDI": "Tireless in his on-field efforts, Blaise Matuidi possesses rare levels of physical and mental strength that help him maintain a dominant presence in midfield. Constantly looking to press opponents and win back the ball, the left-footed player has also worked on his effectiveness further forward since he started out at Troyes aged 17. His impressive maturity ensured him a steady progression through the game, and he continued his development at Saint-Etienne between 2007 and 2011, before becoming one of Paris Saint-Germain's first recruits after the club began its new era as a financial powerhouse.\\r\\nThe move was a dream come true for the avowed PSG fan, and along with Thiago Motta and Marco Verratti he now forms one of the most fearsome midfields in Europe. Matuidi has also been reunited with Laurent Blanc at the Parc des Princes, Blanc having brought him into the France set-up after taking over the reins in August 2010.\\r\\nMatuidi travelled to UEFA EURO 2012 but spent the entirety of the tournament on the bench due to injury, yet he has continued to grow in influence since Didier Deschamps took over as coach. In particular, he caught the eye in the 1-1 draw away against Spain in 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying, as well as France's 3-0 second-leg win against Ukraine in the play-offs last November. "}, {"Moussa SISSOKO": "Born in the suburbs of Paris to Malian parents, Moussa Sissoko has much in common with his idol and fellow midfielder, Mali star Mahamadou Diarra. Sissoko's own playing style was honed in the youth academy at Toulouse, which he joined at a very young age, and he made the step up to the club's first team at 17, having turned heads both at youth level and for the reserves. What he initially lacked in experience, the box-to-box player more than made up for in combativeness, not to mention his astonishing composure.\\r\\nEqually effective in front of the defence or close to the opposition goal, Sissoko appeared 30 times in his debut campaign. Those performances opened the door to the France U-21 side, and the following season he continued his progress, earning his first senior cap in October 2009. He missed out on the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 and made just one outing under Laurent Blanc in August 2010, but he was handed another chance by Didier Deschamps two years later. Sissoko went on to enjoy an active role on the road to Brazil 2014, bolstered by his experiences since signing in 2013 for Newcastle, where he has operated higher up the pitch than he did at Toulouse. "}, {"Paul POGBA": "\"I don\\'t want to be a shooting star,\" proclaimed Paul Pogba in October 2012. Fresh from scoring the winner for Juventus against Bologna, the then 19-year-old was announcing to the watching world his determination to leave his mark. Until that point, the midfielder had mostly made headlines for different reasons, with his move from Le Havre to Manchester United aged 16 stirring up controversy and his switch to Turin three years later also provoking a raft of comments. Far from a problem player, however, Pogba tends to specialise in providing solutions. \\r\\nPhysically imposing at 6\\'3 tall and blessed with sublime technique, sharp vision and a powerful shot, Pogba is a magisterial presence in midfield. His extraordinary potential caught the eye from a young age, and it is no coincidence that he captained France at U-17, U-18, U-19 and U-20 level. As his first coach, Gael Mahe, explained: \"Pogba is an exceptional talent, with huge physical and mental strength, and a rare level of technique that serves his inspired way of playing. His consistency, patience and application will take him to the top of the game.\" Indeed, the youngster left United due to frustration with his limited playing time, feeling that he was being overlooked solely due to inexperience. \\r\\nWith Andrea Pirlo, Claudio Marchisio and Arturo Vidal holding down the midfield spots at , Pogba also began on the bench after moving to Italy in 2012, but he still managed to contest 27 Serie A games in his debut season. Since then, coach Antonio Conte has found it increasingly difficult to leave him out, especially as the Franco-Guinean \u2013 whose brothers have opted to represent Guinea \u2013 collected the adidas Golden Ball as France won the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup. By that point, Pogba had already earned his senior cap in March 2013, and he is now one of Didier Deschamps\\'s most trusted lieutenants. "}, {"Morgan SCHNEIDERLIN": "Morgan Schneiderlin is without a doubt the most unexpected name to feature on France\u2019s 23-man list, even though the hard-working midfielder was regularly involved with his country\u2019s youth teams between 2004 and 2010. After coming through the ranks at Strasbourg, he experienced just one Ligue 1 campaign prior to joining Southampton, then playing in England\u2019s second tier, in 2008.  Over the course of four seasons in the lower divisions, the young Frenchman earned the respect of fans and opponents alike, his tenacious, tough-tackling approach belying his slender build.  In the autumn of 2012, he got his first taste of the Premier League, where he rapidly found his feet, scoring his first top-flight goal on 2 September 2012 against Manchester United. At the end of season 2012/13, he was named Southampton's Player of the Year.  Unfamiliar to the vast majority of football fans in France, Schneiderlin, who had originally been included in Didier Deschamps\u2019 provisional 30-man squad, was called up as a late replacement for the injured Clement Grenier.  "}, {"Sami KHEDIRA": "In a Germany team that has grabbed headlines for its free-flowing attacking style in recent years, Sami Khedira\u2019s tireless running, defensive expertise and on-field leadership have been crucial to adding steel to the creative talent in the side. The holding midfielder has long been a mainstay in Joachim Low\u2019s preferred starting line-up, which is why news that the Real Madrid star has recovered from a cruciate ligament injury sustained last November and been declared fit in time for the 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 has been met with a loud chorus of approval.  \\r\\nEven from an early age it was clear that Khedira, who has a Tunisian father and a German mother, possessed the qualities to succeed at the very top. At the age of eight he joined the renowned Stuttgart academy and won two German youth championships with the Swabians prior to turning professional. He repeated the feat in his debut Bundesliga season in 2006/07, before captaining the Germany U-21 side to the European Championship title in 2009. Khedira, whose younger brother Rani now plays for Stuttgart, moved to Madrid in summer 2010 and went on to win the Spanish league title and the Copa del Rey in subsequent seasons.  \\r\\nKhedira did not need long to establish himself in the Germany set-up but it was at South Africa 2010 that he truly cemented his place in the first team, crowning a series of superb displays at the tournament with the winning goal in the match for third place against Uruguay.  The midfielder, a model professional both on and off the pitch, was among Germany\u2019s best players at UEFA EURO 2012 and started every game as the side swept into the semi-finals, where they were eliminated by Italy. In Brazil he will be aiming to add to an already impressive collection of silverware. "}, {"Bastian SCHWEINSTEIGER": "Any player who wins 50 international caps by the age of 23 is clearly no ordinary talent, yet that best-mark - still a national record in Germany - is not the only reason Bastian Schweinsteiger is a key figure in the three-time FIFA World Cup\u2122 winners\u2019 squad. The Bayern Munich midfielder is the lynchpin of Joachim Low\u2019s Germany side and, after recent successes at club level - including lifting the UEFA Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup trophies - he has his sights set on winning silverware on the biggest stage of them all.\\r\\nA one-club man, having joined Bayern as a 14-year-old, Schweinsteiger was deployed as a right winger at the start of his professional career in 2002, but the Upper Bavarian native is at his best in central midfield where he can dictate the pace of matches. Schweinsteiger\u2019s constant availability to receive a pass, coupled with his reading of the game and top-class technique have made him the perfect link between defence and attack both for Bayern and Germany. Once affectionately known as \u201cSchweini\u201d as a younger player, he has since developed into a true on-field leader who sets the tone for others to follow.\\r\\nSchweinsteiger, who was named as Germany\u2019s Player of the Year in 2013, has amassed over 100 international caps and will not turn 30 until a few weeks after the conclusion of Brazil 2014. He truly became a global household name at the 2006 finals in his homeland, thanks to his brace against Portugal to earn Germany third place. Four years later he was one of the pillars of the national team that again ended up with the bronze medal, a track record that has given him added incentive to do better in Brazil. "}, {"Mesut OEZIL": "Mesut Ozil may be a somewhat shy and reserved character away from the pitch, but he is an explosive presence once he steps on it. His technique, intelligence and ability to bring the ball under control even while running at top speed have made him one of the most feared attacking midfielders in the world, while he also has a clinical eye for goal and can carve open opposition defences with inch-perfect passes. Born in Gelsenkirchen to Turkish parents, Ozil joined FC Schalke from Rot-Weiss Essen as a 16-year-old and went on to make his Bundesliga debut for the Royal Blues a year later. In January 2008, the left-footed playmaker moved to Werder Bremen but it was not until 2009 that his major breakthrough came, when he fired the north German club to glory in the DFB Cup, as well as winning the U-21 European Championship with Germany in Sweden and later establishing himself as a key member of Joachim Low\u2019s senior side. \\r\\nOzil was in the starting line-up for all seven of his country\u2019s matches at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122, repeatedly demonstrating his outstanding ability as one of Germany\u2019s best players at the tournament. The team finished in third place and Ozil\u2019s talent caught the eye of Real Madrid, where he subsequently played for the next three seasons, winning the Spanish league title and the Copa del Rey. In summer 2013 the 26-year-old joined English club Arsenal and he is now eager to dazzle the footballing world once more at Brazil 2014. "}, {"Julian DRAXLER": "In January 2011 Julian Draxler become one of the youngest Bundesliga debutants in history at the age of 17 years and 117 days. A product of the Schalke youth academy, it was immediately apparent that he had the potential to become an exceptional player and just a few months after taking his league bow, the teenager scored the opening goal in his side\u2019s 5-0 cup final victory over MSV Duisburg in Berlin.\\r\\nTall, fast and with a keen eye for goal, Draxler soon became a crowd favourite in Schalke, where he has developed into a cornerstone of the Royal Blues\u2019 team. \\r\\nDraxler also boasts exceptional talent in one-on-one situations from his regular position as a left-sided attacking midfielder, and won the Fritz Walter Medal as the best German player of his age category in 2011. He made his senior international debut shortly before UEFA EURO 2012, although he failed to make the squad for the tournament in Ukraine and Poland. The 20-year-old hinted at his ability to perform at the highest level in his five appearances during 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifying and will be hoping to make his international breakthrough in South America this summer. "}, {"Philipp LAHM": "Philipp Lahm is Germany\\'s Mr. Reliable, with his combination of experience, versatility and unyielding will to win making him an irreplaceable figure in the national side. The Germany captain led Bayern Munich to a long-awaited UEFA Champions League triumph last season, as well as FIFA Club World Cup glory, and having already amassed over 100 international caps he is currently at the peak of his powers. After finishing in third place at the two most recent FIFA World Cups\u2122, Germany 2006 and South Africa 2010, the 30-year-old is determined to finally lift the world\\'s most coveted Trophy at Brazil 2014. Lahm has long been considered one of the finest players in world football thanks to his unruffled composure in possession and skill at reading the game. Those qualities, combined with his outstanding technique, tireless energy and tackling ability have also made him one of the most dangerous full-backs around. Having started out as a left-back, Lahm opted to switch flanks before Pep Guardiola converted him into a defensive midfielder, a change Joachim Low has also frequently adopted in the national side. Aside from a two-year stint with Stuttgart at the beginning of his professional career, the Munich native has played for Bayern since he was 11 and has been a pillar of the Germany team since 2004. In the opening game at Germany 2006, Lahm became a firm fan favourite by breaking the deadlock against Costa Rica in Munich with a stunning strike into the top corner from the edge of area. Four years later he was named as Michael Ballack\\'s successor as captain. It remains to be seen what kind of impact Lahm and the Germany side will have in Brazil, but their objective is to be in the Final at the Maracana: \"I hope I\\'ll be playing football on 13 July,\" Lahm told FIFA.com in an exclusive interview a few months ago."}, {"Toni KROOS": "Even at youth level, Toni Kroos\u2019 extraordinary talent stood out and he has already surpassed expectations since turning professional. The Bayern Munich midfielder\u2019s technique and expert reading of the game have earned him a reputation as one of the best in the business, while he also has a knack of scoring spectacular goals from distance. He is a regular both in Pep Guardiola\u2019s star-stacked side and in the national team under coach Joachim Low. \\r\\nRaised in Greifswald, a town lying on the Baltic Sea, Kroos was part of the Hansa Rostock youth academy for four years before he moved to Bayern as a 16-year-old. Just a year later he helped Germany to a third-placed finish at the FIFA U-17 World Cup Korea 2007, where he won the adidas Golden Ball as the tournament\u2019s best player. Kroos made his Bundesliga debut shortly afterwards, before being sent on an 18-month loan to Bayer Leverkusen at the end of 2009 in order to gain more match practice. Upon his return to Munich, Kroos has since won every title available, including the UEFA Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup. \\r\\nKroos was part of the Germany squads at both the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 and UEFA EURO 2012, but it was not until Brazil 2014 qualifying that he truly cemented his place in the side, scoring three goals in seven appearances. The 24-year-old is now eager to leave a lasting impression on the tournament itself too. "}, {"Christoph KRAMER": "He remains an unknown quantity on the international stage but in Germany, Christoph Kramer is fast becoming a household name. Boasting stamina rivalled by few others in the Bundesliga, the 23-year-old made a central midfield berth his own at Borussia Monchengladbach in 2013/14 and emerged as a star in his own right. Even after regular Germany midfielders Ilkay Gundogan and Lars Bender were ruled out of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 with injury, few expected Kramer to somehow play himself into contention for the final 23-man squad. The Solinger-born man proved the doubters wrong, however, earning plaudits from all angles and fighting his way on to the plane to Brazil. A youth team player at Bayer 04 Leverkusen and Fortuna Dusseldorf, he signed his first professional contract at Leverkusen in 2010. Despite appearing for Germany\u2019s U-19 and U-20 sides, he struggled for first-team action at his club, and in 2011 he decided to move to Bundesliga 2 club VfL Bochum on loan. It was from there that his career took off, as he established himself as one of the second tier\u2019s standout players and Germany\u2019s hottest prospects. At the beginning of the 2013/14 campaign he extended his deal with Leverkusen, simultaneously agreeing a loan move to traditional powerhouses Monchengladbach. He missed just one game all season as the Foals qualified for the UEFA Europa League, and was rewarded with his senior international debut in a 0-0 friendly draw with Poland on 13 May. "}, {"Michael ESSIEN": "While he is no doubt showing his age, Michael Essien remains a valuable member of the Ghana set-up. The dogged midfielder\u2019s international career began in the deep end at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations in 2002, but he recovered from a rough start to become the foundation of the national team. Essien missed out on South Africa 2010\\xa0with a cruel knee injury and is looking to Brazil 2014 to banish those memories. Even in the twilight of his career, Essien, who played for Ghana at Germany 2006, is still a dangerous and inspirational figure.\\r\\nEssien began his European career with an unsuccessful trial at Manchester United. He may not have earned a contract, but he did famously leave Old Trafford with David Beckham\u2019s autograph. Idling for several months in his agent\u2019s flat in Monaco, Essien eventually signed with Bastia in France and three seasons later he moved to Lyon, where he won successive Ligue 1 titles in 2004 and 2005 and was voted the league\u2019s best player. A big-money transfer to English Premier League outfit Chelsea catapulted Essien into the international limelight and he spent the next nine seasons with the Londoners before moving on loan to Real Madrid. He returned to Chelsea at the start of the 2013/14 campaign but struggled to make an impact before moving to AC Milan. Essien\u2019s trophy cabinet is filled with Premier League titles, FA Cup triumphs and even the UEFA Champions League. Despite not playing in the final when Chelsea beat Bayern Munich, the defender\u2019s place as an immortal Ghanaian legend is safe enough.

Regulations prevented him from being signed by the Belfast-based club and he returned to Ghana and started playing for Bechem United. He was spotted for a second time playing a friendly against Serie A club Empoli and later joined Palermo. After early success with Palermo, he moved to Parma and was then snapped up by big-spending Bundesliga club Hoffenheim, where he struggled though and failed to play a single league match. His career took a downward spiral and the World Cup finals in Brazil seemed an unreachable dream. A loan move back to Parma changed things though and the 22-year-old started playing regularly in Serie A. \"I dreamed about playing at the World Cup every day; every player would.

He played in all seven matches of the competition and was key to the team\u2019s success. Agyemang-Badu has lined up at the last three CAF African Cups of Nations, where Ghana finished second (2010) and fourth twice (2012 and 2013).

After his performances at the U-20 World Cup, he was signed by Italy\u2019s Udinese, a club with a keen eye on talent across west Africa.

It took him time to realise his promise. Two loan spells at lower league clubs Lorient and Arles-Avignon helped him gain the experience he needed, and, in 2010, he was recalled to OM by then coach Didier Deschamps. He has not looked back, becoming a regular and playing UEFA Champions League football as he moves from strength to strength.\\r\\nHe briefly retired from international football last year but returned in time to take part in the Black Stars' deciding group qualifier against Zambia, as well as the two play-off matches against Egypt, by which Ghana secured a third consecutive appearance at the World Cup.

"}, {"Sulley MUNTARI": "Midfielder Sulley Muntari has competed at the highest levels of club football and stores some of its most-prized silverware in his trophy cabinet. He developed from a teenage prodigy into an instantly recognisable world star, competing admirably amid the rigours and demands of Italy\u2019s Serie A. Muntari, a rugged, box-to-box midfielder, was barely 16 when he lined up for Ghana at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in\\xa02001 and he immediately caught the eye of international clubs and their agents.

I asked the street wardens whether I could join the team and they said \u2018yes.\u2019 From there it developed into playing every Sunday for two or three years.

This early move to Europe was a false dawn, however, and Rabiu spent time out on dead-end loans in Spain and Italy before finding a home in France with Evian. It was here that he developed into a strong midfielder and helped the club secure back-to-back promotions to reach the top flight for the first time in their history.\\r\\nRabiu was a member of the Ghana squad at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations in 2013, where the Black Stars finished fourth.

"}, {"Ioannis MANIATIS": "A versatile player who played ten games in qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, Ioannis 'Giannis' Maniatis started his career as a right-back at Panionios, whom he represented\\xa0for the best part of a decade after signing professional terms in 2003. He made his Greece debut in a 1-0 friendly win over Serbia in 2010, before making the move to Greek heavyweights Olympiacos in early 2011. The switch saw him initially provide support as a fullback, but a career-changing moment came prior to a UEFA Champions League match later that year against Marseille. Shorn of options in the middle of the park, then Olympiacos coach Ernesto Valverde switched Maniatis to midfield, and the No2 was a revelation, putting in a superb performance and earning plaudits across his homeland. As a result, Maniatis was thereafter primarily deployed as a holding midfielder as he won three Greek Super Leagues in his first three seasons with the . His success in the position saw him establish himself in Greece\u2019s starting line-up for UEFA EURO 2012 and throughout qualifying for Brazil.  "}, {"Alexandros TZIOLIS": "A classy, ball-playing deep lying midfielder, Alexandros Tziolis has been a steady presence in Greek squads since making his debut against Korea Republic in a 2006 friendly. He made the squad for UEFA EURO 2008, making one substitute appearance against eventual winners Spain as Otto Rehhagel\u2019s holders crashed out in the group stages. Tziolis came into favour towards the end of qualifying for the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 and, despite playing just four games on the road to South Africa, played in all three of his country\u2019s matches at the finals. He played ten games in qualifying for Brazil 2014, firmly establishing himself in the side despite missing out on the squad for EURO 2012. Tziolis\u2019 club career has seen him travel all over Europe. After coming through the ranks at Panionios, he joined Panathinaikos in 2005 but enjoyed mixed success with He was loaned to Werder Bremen in 2009, where he played in the last UEFA Cup final and lifted the German Cup. Since then, he has turned out for Siena in Italy, Racing Santander in Spain, Monaco in France and won the Cypriot title in 2013 with APOEL Nicosia. He spent the latter half of the 2013/14 season on loan at Turkish side Kayserispor after returning to Greece with PAOK last year. "}, {"Panagiotis KONE": "Albanian-born Panagiotis Kone has an eye for a sensational goal, he was nominated for the 2013 FIFA Pusk\u00e0s Award, and the tricky winger brings a bit of flair to the Greek squad. Kone often found himself on the bench throughout qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, and the two games he started (both against Liechtenstein), saw two wins for Fernando Santos\u2019 side. The attacking midfielder made his Greece debut against Austria in a friendly in late 2010, but failed to make the squad for UEFA EURO 2012, after he was sent off against Slovenia, one of the final friendlies before the tournament. Kone\u2019s footballing education has been an intriguing one, and differs from many of his Greek team-mates. After starting off at Olympiacos, French side Lens drafted him into their youth setup before he signed his first professional contract with AEK Athens. After moving to Iraklis, he switched Greece for Italy with Brescia and established himself in Italian Serie A before a switch to current side Bologna. His undoubted highlight for the  was that Pusk\u00e0s-nominated goal against Napoli, an unstoppable scissor kick from the edge of the box. Santos will be hoping he can call on Kone for some more magic in Brazil. "}, {"Georgios KARAGOUNIS": "One of the few stars of UEFA EURO 2004 who are still playing, Karagounis has become synonymous with the dogged determination which the footballing world now associate with the Greek national side, after Fernando Santos inherited the hard-working  from Otto Rehhagel. What Karagounis lacks in height, he certainly makes up for in work ethic, with Greece\u2019s captain renowned for his ability to stick to his task thanks to his resolute attitude. He rose to prominence after captaining Greece to the UEFA U-21 EURO final in 1998, making his full international bow a year later after signing for Panathinaikos. Despite not winning a major honour with the  during his first spell at the club, he impressed on the continental stage, with a series of memorable performances including a run to the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals in 2002. Karagounis\u2019s finest hour, and indeed his country\u2019s finest footballing moment, came during EURO 2004. The midfielder opened the scoring at the tournament with a low drive from distance against hosts Portugal. There was personal heartbreak for the-then Inter Milan midfielder, as he picked up an 87th-minute booking in the semi-final against Czech Republic which ruled him out of the final, also against the hosts. Rehhagel\u2019s troops had enough without their midfield general though, and saw off Portugal to claim their maiden tournament\\xa0triumph at full international level. Since then, Karagounis has gone on to become Greece\u2019s most-capped player, overtaking Theo Zagorakis with his 121st international appearance in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifier against Bosnia-Herzegovina in October 2012. He played ten matches on the road to Brazil, with six of those coming from the bench. Despite the waning number of starts for the 37-year-old, his influence is still huge in the Greek camp and Fernando Santos, who worked with the midfielder at Benfica, clearly holds him in high regard due to the sureness the veteran exudes. \u201cWe have confidence and know we can beat any opponent,\u201d Karagounis said during World Cup qualifying. "}, {"Lazaros CHRISTODOULOPOULOS": "Despite making his debut back in 2008, Lazaros Christodoulopoulos has had to wait for his opportunity in the Greece side, having missed out on consecutive tournaments at UEFA EURO 2008,\\xa0the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 and EURO 2012. The languid winger with a vicious long-range drive has forged a formidable reputation since moving to Serie A side Bologna in early 2013. He exploded on to the scene in Italy, grabbing a goal on his debut against Fiorentina after coming on as a substitute. He has gone on to establish himself as a key component of\\xa0squad since joining from Panathinaikos, where he picked up a Greek league and cup double in 2010. Fernando Santos has taken on board the impact Christodoulopoulos has had at club level and played him in every qualifying group game after he grabbed the winner against Lithuania in Vilnius. The Bologna man was on the bench for the play-off games against Romania, but his place in the finals squad gives Santos some much-needed flair to unpick the Colombian, Japanese and Ivorian defences. "}, {"Konstantinos KATSOURANIS": "Konstantinos Katsouranis\\xa0has been a key part of the Greece midfield since his first call-up in 2003 and was a mainstay of the team that shocked Europe at UEFA EURO 2004.\\xa0The steely midfielder\\xa0also featured in the Greeks' failed attempt to defend their continental crown in 2008. He played in all three group games at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 and played a part in his country\u2019s first victory in the competition, laying on the pass for Dimitrios Salpingidis\u2019s winner against Nigeria. Katsouranis\u2019s career began back in 1996 with Panachaiki, based in his home city of Patras, helping them to promotion to the Greek top flight before departing for AEK Athens in 2002. He was named Greece\u2019s Player of the Year in 2005 and continued to impress the following year when AEK finished league runners-up to claim a place in the UEFA Champions League. It was at that point that Katsouranis decided to follow AEK coach -\\xa0his now national team boss - Fernando Santos to Benfica. Salpingidis\\xa0was named the club\u2019s Player of the Year in 2009, when he also added a Portuguese cup triumph to his roll of honour. He then moved back Greece to join Panathinaikos, the club he had supported all his life. He picked up a Greek Super League and cup double to his trophy cabinet before joining current side PAOK in December 2012. The reliable Katsouranis featured heavily in Greece\u2019s journey to Brazil, often captaining the side in the absence of Giorgios Karagounis. It was only suspension that prevented the No21 from featuring more often, as he picked up several yellow cards during qualifying as well as being dismissed against Latvia. The veteran midfielder turns 35 during this summer\u2019s tournament and his experience is key to Greece achieving their goals. "}, {"Andreas SAMARIS": "A strong holding midfielder who has added goalscoring to his already impressive armoury in the last few seasons, Andreas Samaris came into Fernando Santos\u2019s thinking toward the end of Greece\u2019s road to Brazil. The midfielder made a substitute appearance in the final group qualifier against Liechtenstein and rose from the bench in the two play-off matches against Romania. A determined player who has flourished under the stewardship of former Spain midfielder Michel at Olympiacos, Samaris began his career at Panachaiki before earning a move to Panionis in the Greek Super League. His impressive performances in the centre of the park for the  caught the attention of perennial Greek champions Olympiacos, who signed him on a permanent deal in 2012, before loaning him back for the duration of the 2012/13 campaign to the Nea Smyrni Stadium. Since his return to Olympiacos, Samaris has formed a crucial part of the  midfield, playing every minute of the UEFA Champions League group stages which saw his side emerge to face Manchester United, and elimination, in the knockout stages. The tall midfield man picked up the first silverware of his career as Olympiacos confirmed their 41st league title in March. "}, {"Panagiotis TACHTSIDIS": "Defensive midfielder Panagiotis Tachtsidis has found it difficult to dislodge the old guard in the centre of the park for Greece, but his technique and Italian footballing pedigree means he is one for the future for Fernando Santos. Making his full national team debut aged 21, a few months after\\xa0UEFA EURO 2012, Tachtsidis played just 67 minutes in qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, but was named in eight of the 12 squads on Greece\u2019s road there.  His club career has seen him rack up eight clubs at the age of just 23. The left-footed midfielder started his career at AEK Athens, making his Greek Super League debut aged 16 alongside Brazilian legend Rivaldo. At 18, he appeared in the UEFA Europa League for the  and made his move to Italian football with Genoa the following year. Tachtsidis has since become something of a journeyman of the Italian game, with mixed loan spells at Cesena and Grosseto followed by a successful loan at Verona, who narrowly missed out on promotion to Serie A at the end of the 2011/12 season. That spell impressed giants Roma sufficiently to sign the midfielder permanently from Genoa. As part of the complicated co-ownership deal, he returned to Genoa in 2013 before signing for current side Catania, who in turn loaned him to Torino in January. "}, {"Emilio IZAGUIRRE": "Emilio Izaguirre is the undisputed first choice left-back for both the Honduras national team and for his club Celtic, where he has played since 2010. \\r\\nIn Scotland he has demonstrated his ability to combine defensive solidity with attacking menace, and his unrelenting desire to make dangerous overlapping runs has helped add variety to his teams\u2019 forward forays. \\r\\nEven prior to signing professional terms,  stood out as a youngster at Motagua and was also in his country\u2019s starting line-up at the FIFA U-20 World Youth Championship Netherlands 2005.

He has been an ever-present in Luis Fernando Suarez\u2019s Honduras side and played 1128 minutes in 14 matches en route to the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, where he is expected to be a marauding presence from the off. "}, {"Wilson PALACIOS": "Wilson Palacios belongs among a select group of players with the ability to change the course of a game on his own. Known as\\xa0('The Magician') because of his ability on the ball, Palacios is the kind of central midfielder every coach would like in his side.\\r\\nPalacios' professional career began at\\xa0Victoria in 2000 but just a year later he joined Olimpia, one of Honduras' most historic clubs.\\xa0The stocky midfielder's knack of scoring goals and providing assists, coupled with his\\xa0gift for long-range shooting, earned him a call-up to the national side and he made his international debut in a friendly against Paraguay in 2003.\\xa0\\r\\nHis talents did not go unnoticed further afield and Palacios\\xa0has plied his trade in England ever since\\xa0Birmingham City secured his signature\\xa0in 2007. He was a pillar of the Honduran side during 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 qualification and was instrumental in helping end the country's 28-year absence at the finals. At that tournament, he and his brothers Jerry and Johnny\\xa0gave Honduras the curious honour of becoming the first nation to compete at a World Cup with a trio of siblings in their squad.\\xa0On the books at Stoke City for the last three seasons, Palacios played 838 minutes spread across 11 matches for Honduras en route to Brazil 2014 and would have appeared more often but for a series of injuries. Now back to full fitness and approaching his 30th birthday, he is currently at the peak of his powers and will be intent on underlining that on the global stage this summer. "}, {"Jerry PALACIOS": "Jerry Palacios comes from a football family, having shared the dressing room at first club Olimpia \u2013 where he made the breakthrough in 2001 \u2013 with no fewer than three of his brothers. The forward's biggest asset is his strapping frame, which enables him to bounce off defenders and makes him an ideal foil for Honduras strike partner and namesake Jerry Bengtson. The 32-year-old earned his first international call-up for a friendly against USA just a year into his career. However, he has been in and out of the picture since then and was only a last-minute inclusion in the squad for South Africa 2010, where he and siblings Johnny and Wilson made history as the first trio of brothers to represent a single country at the same FIFA World Cup\u2122. Having signed for Chinese outfit Hangzhou Greentown in January that year, 2010 also marked the beginning of the marksman's international adventure at club level. He spent one year there and another at Hunan Billows before returning home in 2012, rejoining former club Marathon and then moving on to Platense. However, Palacios seemingly possesses itchy feet to go along with his powerful legs and the industrious forward goes into Brazil 2014 on the back of his debut season in Costa Rica with Alajuelense. "}, {"Mario MARTINEZ": "Blessed with all the qualities a top-class playmaker needs, Mario Martinez shines when sitting just off the shoulder of a main striker, but his finely-tuned left boot, thundering long-distance shot and excellent movement mean he is equally able to lead the line himself.\\r\\nAfter making over 50 appearances at Real Espana, where he began life as a professional in 2006, Martinez moved to Europe, joining Norwegian side Valerenga in 2009 before switching to Belgian giants Anderlecht in 2010. He was called up to the national team for the first time later that year and scored on his debut against El Salvador. \\r\\nHowever, his career did not pan out as planned on the Old Continent and he returned to Real Espana later in 2010. He was part of the triumphant Honduran side at the 2011 Copa Centroamericana and played nine matches on the road to the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, hitting the target twice. \\r\\nWhile he has not been a first team regular in the Honduras side over the past year, his scintillating performances with his club in the last season did not go unnoticed by national team coach Luis Fernando Suarez, who will be keen to utilise his attacking talents. "}, {"Edder DELGADO": "Edder Delgado will arrive at Brazil 2014 in the form of his life.

"}, {"Boniek GARCIA": "Having watched on from the bench at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122, 29-year-old attacking midfielder Oscar Garcia looks well placed to make an impression for Honduras on the world stage this time around. The son of a professional footballer, Garcia's middle name, Boniek, is a tribute to the Juventus and Poland legend Zbigniew. Though lacking the goalscoring touch (but not the stamina) of the 1980s star, the technically gifted midfield dynamo is an extremely useful player in his own right, serving as a creative heartbeat in the middle of the park. Garcia made his name domestically at Olimpia, for whom he enjoyed two stints either side of a short spell at Marathon. He received his first international call-up for a 2005 friendly against Canada and subsequently established himself as a regular in the squad, although \u2013 as already noted \u2013 he did not make it onto the pitch at South Africa 2010. After failing to earn a deal during a trial in France, in 2012 the midfield schemer joined Houston Dynamo, where he has been a revelation. So good has Garcia's form been at club level that he has forced himself into the starting line-up for Honduras, for whom he played 13 times in qualifying for Brazil 2014.

He has been a mainstay in the Honduras camp ever since and helped fire the team to South Africa 2010, ending the country\u2019s 28-year wait to appear at a World Cup. Espinoza also featured at the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament at London 2012, where he found the net against Brazil. \\xa0 \\r\\nHis eye-catching displays there paved the way for his move to the English Premier League with Wigan the following year. Espinoza was a first-team regular in Honduras\u2019 Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign, tasting 1079 minutes of action across 12 matches, and he will be crucial to his country\u2019s hopes of success in South America. "}, {"Andy NAJAR": "Rising star Andy Najar is definitely one to watch both now and in the future. Despite his tender years, the 21-year-old Honduran international has already amassed a fair amount of big-game experience, including featuring at the 2012 Olympic Games in London and in the latter stages of qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122. What the pint-sized attacking midfielder lacks in height, he more than makes up for with his blistering pace, which enables him to burst past opposition players at will. Coupled with natural flair, this readiness to take on defenders makes the youngster a potentially consistent match-winner, offering an extra dimension to Honduras going forward and able to lead the charge on the counter-attack. Having moved to the USA with his family at the age of 13, Najar signed for DC United in 2010, going on to open his goalscoring account not long after. Some three years and 82 appearances later, the starlet was Europe-bound after agreeing a deal to join Belgian giants Anderlecht. Najar became a full international in 2011, winning his first cap in a friendly against Colombia, and has gone on to nail down his place in Luis Suarez's squad. As well as playing three times at London 2012, he took part in five qualifiers for this summer's tournament, all in 2013. "}, {"Luis GARRIDO": "Luis Garrido has risen to prominence in Honduran football thanks to the fierce on-field battling qualities that have earned him the nickname\\xa0\\xa0('The Beast'). The diminutive defensive midfielder is deceptively quick and is highly effective at breaking up opposition attacks, although some of his best performances have come when fielded on the left, from where he cuts inside onto his stronger right foot to instigate attacks with his pinpoint passing. \\r\\nGarrido made his senior debut at club level for Juticalpa in 2007 and after a string of consistently good displays he moved to Olimpia at the end of the season.

The next year saw him figure in his first AFC Champions League during which Sepahan finished as runners-up, but as winners Urawa Red Diamonds had also won that year's J.League, the Iranians were fortunately granted a place at the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup. Haji Safi played in both his side's games during the campaign, including excelling in their 3-1 opening victory against Waitakere United.  Haji Safi broke into the Iran national team under Ali Daei in 2008 and he immediately repaid the legend's faith in him, providing two assists on his international debut against Zambia. From then on, he has appeared in over half a century of matches for Team Melli.

The  captain is Iran\\'s second most capped player in history with 136 international appearances, trailing only legendary goal-king Ali Daei\\'s 149.  Since making his national team debut against Syria in a friendly in May 2000, he went on to impress in Iran\\'s opening two matches at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany\u2122. Although he was suspended for the closing group match and his side failed to progress to the second round, his eye-catching displays earned him a high-profile move to Osasuna.  During six years with the Spanish La Liga side Nekounam established his place as one of Iran\u2019s most successful overseas-based players. That, allied with his consistent performances with the national team, saw him inherit the captain\u2019s armband from the talismanic Mehdi Mahdavikia in 2009.  Deployed as a central midfielder, Nekounam plays a key role in both Iran\u2019s defence and attack. Aside from dealing with rival offences, he has always been at the centre of Iran\u2019s more positive intentions, with his tally of 37 international goals making him the current squad\u2019s top marksman.   While steering Iran to their fourth global appearance, Nekounam maintained no-less-impressive form during \u2019s qualifying for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup. He finished as the tournament\\'s second top-marksman as Iran sealed progression to the continental finals. Recently he has been found excelling with his new club Al Kuwait, scoring five times in just 12 appearances.

Three years later he moved on to Fajr-Sepasi, eventually being appointed captain for the 2012/13 season by coach Mahmoud Yavari. His solid displays and commitment earned widespread recognition by media across Asia, with his international debut coming in a friendly against Botswana in 2009.

Despite two short loan spells with Naft Teheran and Teraktor-Sazi, Hadadifar has proven dedicated to Zob Ahan, spending the rest of his career so far with his home club.  A skilful midfielder, Hadadifar proved an integral component as Zob Ahan finished runners-up both domestically and in the AFC Champions League in 2010, feats which earned him a national team call-up. The next couple of seasons saw him impress through his dynamic runs and ferocious shooting as he steered Teraktor-Sazi to their maiden Champions League qualification and helped Zob Ahan maintain their place in the top flight.

With his international debut not coming until August 2005 in a friendly against Libya \u2013 after Iran had secured a place at Germany 2006, Timotian surprised even his own supporters by making it into Branko Ivankovic\u2019s World Cup squad. Aside from showcasing his talents on the global stage, the midfielder cut an emotional figure as Iran crashed out with a 1-1 draw against Angola in the closing group match. After the final whistle he collapsed on the turf, sobbing wildly and being comforted by coaches \u2013 a poignant scene which made him a national hero in the eyes of Iranian fans. Eight years have elapsed but the ex-Bolton Wanderers and Fulham man's aspirations for success have yet to diminish. Having been an integral in qualifying for Brazil 2014, the player is brimming with renewed passion and added confidence heading into his second World Cup.    A defensive midfielder, Timotian is dangerous whenever he surges forward. His attacking prowess was highlighted in last year\u2019s AFC Champions League quarter-final clash when the dynamic player, having seen his corner turned in by a team-mate, unleashed a long-range effort in stoppage-time to seal a decisive 2-1 victory for Esteghlal at Buriram United.  "}, {"Bakhtiar RAHMANI": "Despite being just a 22-year-old, Bakhtiar Rahmani has already demonstrated his talents, vision and leadership with both club and country, merits that have made him stand out among Iran's up-and-comers.  Born in Sarpol-e Zahab, Rahmani was recruited into Foolad's youth academy in 2006. His progress was such that he graduated to the senior side the next season and after a series of solid performances in the following years, he surprised even his own supporters when he was chosen as the team's captain in 2012 to fill the void left by of Jalal Kameli Mofrad.  The creative player has been one of Foolad's most consistent performers over the recent years. Notably, he provided 15 assists \u2013 while scoring another three \u2013 in the 2009/10 season. After being named the captain of Iran's U-23 side in 2011, his international debut for the senior side came last year when Carlos Queiroz called him up for a friendly against Oman.  "}, {"Hashem BEIKZADEH": "Having won the domestic league on four occasions, twice with Esteghlal and Sepahan each, Hashem Beikzadeh's next goal is to continue his good form with his country into the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 campaign.  Deployed at either left-back or in midfield, Beikzadeh has caught the eye in the past with his spectacular efforts from dead balls. One of his most notable was a fine thumped 25-yard free-kick against Iraq in during the 2007 West Asian Football Federation Championship, a feat which further singled him out as one of the side's set-piece specialist.  Since making his international debut in a friendly against United Arab Emirates in back in 2006, Beikzadeh has racked up 16 national team appearances. He played just one game in their failed bid to reach South Africa 2010 but his solid performances with Esteghlal earned the faith of Carlos Queiroz, who started him in the last two qualifying matches against Lebanon and Korea Republic, where two wins saw Iran seal progression. "}, {"Thiago MOTTA": "A Brazilian-born , Thiago Motta is a veritable sentinel in the middle of the park, capable of operating as a holding player or deep-lying orchestrator. Since 9 February 2011, he has been bringing his considerable skills to bear for Italy, with Cesare Prandelli inviting him into the fold to bolster a midfield undergoing transition. An athletic and sturdy presence at 6'2, Motta kicked off his career at Sao Paolo side Juventus, before leaving for Europe to join Barcelona aged 17. He soon displayed his talent in Spain, thanks to his strength, vision, percussive passing and sheer calm under pressure. In short, he injects a measure of composure on the pitch, though he has often been plagued by muscle injuries down the years.  Motta's family hail from Veneto, so, having never represented Brazil in a competitive match, he took his first steps with Italy in a 1-1 draw against Germany at the age of 28 in February 2011. He went on to start three games at UEFA EURO 2012, though his tournament ultimately ended in anguish as he suffered a muscle tear in the final. Consistently excellent performances for Paris Saint-Germain nonetheless offered him a route back into the side last September, and Motta contested Italy's decisive qualifiers on the road to Brazil 2014.\\xa0 "}, {"Antonio CANDREVA": "Attacking midfielder Antonio Candreva has represented his country at one level or another since turning professional in 2004. The 27-year-old's preferred position is tucked in behind a striker, but since joining Lazio in January 2012 he has been used effectively on the flanks as well, not least thanks to his pace and dribbling ability. Sprightly and skilful, he also boasts a knack for spectacular goals from distance.\\xa0 Originally from Rome, he gained his grounding in the game at Ternana, where he also made his first-team debut, before signing for Udinese in 2007. From there, he began a series of loan spells, spending two seasons at Livorno, six months at Juventus and a year apiece at Parma and Cesena. Despite the regular change of scenery, he was awarded a maiden Italy cap by Marcello Lippi on 14 November 2009, featuring in a goalless draw against the Netherlands at the age of 22. Included in a preliminary squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122, he eventually missed the cut for South Africa along with Fabio Grosso. \\r\\nThree years after taking his international bow, Candreva was selected by Cesare Prandelli for the Brazil 2014 qualifier against Armenia on 12 October 2012, which Italy won 3-1. He has since become a regular fixture for . "}, {"Claudio MARCHISIO": "Widely considered the natural heir of former great Marco Tardelli, one of the driving forces behind Italy's 1982 FIFA World Cup\u2122 win, Claudio Marchisio is an elegant midfielder with a strong personality. A proud product of the Juventus youth system, he captained Italy at every youth level, with his innate gifts becoming apparent at a young age. Above all, his stamina, close control and powerful long-range shooting allow him to excel anywhere in midfield, while his vision and intelligence set him apart from his peers. Marchisio made his Juventus debut under Didier Deschamps in 2006 as the club sought, and eventually sealed, a return to Serie A. With all the talent at 's disposal, however, it would be some time before he could hold down a regular starting berth. His persistence paid off, and in August 2009, aged 23, he made his senior Italy debut under Marcello Lippi. Nevertheless, it was after Antonio Conte and Cesare Prandelli took charge of Juventus and Italy respectively that his career really began to soar. In the wake of 's disappointing 2010 World Cup bid, Marchisio was the only player along with Gianluigi Buffon and Andrea Pirlo to contest every minute for Italy at UEFA EURO 2012, and he was involved again at the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013. \\xa0 \\xa0 "}, {"Alberto AQUILANI": "A technically gifted midfielder who likes to play in the hole, Alberto Aquilani is a product of the Roma training academy, where he started out at the age of 15. Thanks to his finesse on the ball and ability to shoot from distance, he quickly got himself noticed. As well as making his way at Roma he also broke into Italy\u2019s youth set-up, distinguishing himself at the 2003 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, where he won the Golden Player Award. Right from his debut in Serie A, Aquilani earned rave reviews for his sublime technique and shooting skills. He was at the top of his game in November 2006, when he had the misfortune of suffering a serious knee injury that sidelined him for six months. Only a week before, he had made his full international debut in a 1-1 friendly draw with Turkey. He took part in Italy\u2019s UEFA EURO 2008 campaign but was left out of Marcello Lippi\u2019s 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 at the last minute. Invited back into the fold by Cesare Prandelli, he started all five of Italy\u2019s games at last year\u2019s FIFA Confederations Cup. \\xa0 "}, {"Daniele DE ROSSI": "Born and bred in the Eternal City, Daniele De Rossi rose through the ranks at Roma and has never represented any other club. A proficient holding midfielder who protects the defence with aplomb, he is also quick to try his luck from distance whenever the chance arises \u2013 qualities which have helped him contest over 300 games for . The perfect foil to Roma ace Francesco Totti, he also shares his club-mate's burning will to win and\\xa0the character to match. A European champion with the Italian U-21s in 2004, De Rossi also won bronze at the 2004 Men's Olympic Football Tournament in Athens. He was promoted to full international duty in a qualifier for the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122 against Norway just a few months later, contributing a debut goal in a 2-1 victory. On 30 March the following year, and still only 21, he then donned the captain's armband for the first time in the second half of a 0-0 friendly draw with Iceland. Germany 2006 proved to be an up-and-down affair for De Rossi. Sent off just 26 minutes into the group match against USA, he received a four-match suspension, only making his return in the second half of the Final against France \u2013 but, crucially, converting his penalty in the shoot-out. Like his team-mates, he was then unable to shine in South Africa four years later, but that did not dent his reputation in the eyes of incoming coach Cesare Prandelli. A versatile performer capable of playing in almost every position, he has settled into the role of defensive midfielder. Nothing short of a pillar for Italy, he was voted Italian Sportsman of the Year in 2010 and was included in the Team of the Tournament at UEFA EURO 2012. During the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil, he notched his 15th international goal against Japan, thereby surpassing the great Gianni Rivera to become \u2019s highest scoring midfielder.\\xa0 \\xa0 "}, {"Marco PAROLO": "Marco Parolo is a central midfielder who enjoys advancing up the pitch and can strike a vicious shot with both feet. First taught the ropes at Como, he made his first-team debut with the Lombardy outfit in the third division but had to leave after the club went bankrupt. Parolo then spent several seasons passing from one club to the next without being given time to demonstrate his true ability. \\r\\nHe eventually found stability at Cesena, where coach Pierpaolo Bisoli brought him under his wing in 2009. The switch was a success, and on 29 March 2011 Parolo made his Italy debut in a 2-0 friendly win against Ukraine, coming off the bench in place of Claudio Marchisio. Cesena's relegation from the top flight hindered his progress, but he signed for Parma in 2012 and Cesare Prandelli proved he had not forgotten the midfielder when he called him up again for the 2-2 draw against Nigeria on 18 November last year. Winning his second cap, Parolo came on for Thiago Motta. "}, {"Andrea PIRLO": "The years have clearly not yet taken their toll on Andrea Pirlo, who remains Italy\\'s imperious midfield maestro. As comfortable playing just in front of the defence as he is carrying out more advanced duties, he is completely two-footed, endowed with fantastic vision and an unparalleled passer of the ball. If that were not enough, he is also a remarkable free-kick taker. It was Carlo Ancelotti who suggested he operate in a more withdrawn role while the duo were at AC Milan in 2002, and Pirlo quickly settled into his new duties alongside midfield comrades Gennaro Gattuso and Clarence Seedorf. This tactical masterstroke brought  great success, while Pirlo \u2013 dubbed \"a Zico in front of the defence\" by former Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira \u2013 became practically irreplaceable. In the space of nine years at Milan, the Italy stalwart secured two UEFA Champions League titles, a FIFA Club World Cup, a pair of Serie A crowns, two UEFA Super Cups and an Italian Cup Pirlo made his  debut at the age of 23 in 2002, but he had to wait two more years until the second fixture of UEFA EURO 2004 before establishing himself as a starter. Nicknamed  (Tinkerbell) or (the Architect) by his team-mates, he then enjoyed his greatest triumph at the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122, where he was voted Man of the Match in the duels with Ghana, hosts Germany and Final opponents France. Two years later, he contested three group games at EURO 2008, while injury kept his involvement in Italy\\'s 2010 World Cup debacle to a minimum. Soon after taking the reins, Cesare Prandelli made Pirlo his vice-captain behind Gianluigi Buffon, and the midfielder paid him back by performing superbly at EURO 2012, picking up three further Man of the Match awards in six outings. Pirlo then celebrated another landmark achievement by collecting his 100 cap during the FIFA Confederations Cup on 16 June last year. \\xa0 "}, {"Marco VERRATTI": "Still only 21, Marco Verratti already looks to possess the finest attributes of two Italian legends, combining Andrea Pirlo's vision and ability to dictate a game with Gennaro Gattuso's drive, commitment and thirst for victory. Originally from Pescara, Verratti turned professional with his local club at 16, following eight years spent in the youth set-up. Just 5'5 tall but extremely dynamic, he was originally fielded as a  \u2013 a playmaker sitting behind the centre-forward \u2013 but that all changed when Zdenek Zeman took over the helm for the 2011/12 campaign. The then teenager was repositioned in front of the defence to better organise the team's play, and he soon won praise for his rapid ball distribution and capacity to vary Pescara's routes to goal. Verratti's influence grew as the season unfolded and he helped steer the club to promotion from Serie B, in the process earning himself the nickname 'The Pirlo of Abruzzo'. Subsequently lured to Paris Saint-Germain by Carlo Ancelotti, he quickly secured a starting spot in a line-up brimming with star names, and it was only a matter of time before Italy came calling. A maiden cap swiftly followed on 15 August 2012, when Verratti featured in a 2-1 friendly loss to England at the age of 19.\\xa0 "}, {"Yasuhito ENDO": "For more than a decade, midfielder Yasuhito Endo has been a mainstay of the Japanese national team, where his creativity, precise passing and unerring free-kicks have been major weapons. Japan\u2019s most-capped player, Endo has spent his entire career in the J.League \u2013 a rarity these days for top-class Japanese players.  Endo made his professional debut for Yokohama Flugels (now Yokohama F. Marinos) in 1998, the year Japan played in its first FIFA World Cup\u2122. After a stint with Kyoto Sanga, he joined Gamba Osaka in 2001, where he still plays and remains a fan favourite. Endo guided Gamba to its maiden AFC Champions League title in 2008, and his impressive performance in a 5-3 loss against Manchester United in the FIFA Club World Cup that year even earned praise from manager Sir Alex Ferguson. \\r\\nGamba were demoted to the second division for the first time in 2012, but significantly Endo stayed and helped the club bounce back the following campaign. Although originally a defensive midfielder, the 34-year-old showed his versatility last season by even playing up front at times.  Born in Kagoshima Prefecture, Endo is the youngest (and most successful) of three brothers who played football. As he steadily progressed through the national team ranks, he helped Japan reach the semi-finals of the 1999 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Nigeria, and played at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Perhaps the biggest disappointment of his career, however, was the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Despite being selected in the squad by coach Zico, Endo was not granted any playing time. Determined to make amends for this setback, the midfielder worked even harder to polish his game.  His conscientious work paid off at South Africa 2010, where he scored a trademark free-kick against Denmark in the group stage that helped the Samurai Blue reach the Round of 16.  "}, {"Toshihiro AOYAMA": "A midfield anchorman with Sanfrecce Hiroshima, Toshihiro Aoyama won many plaudits in helping his side to consecutive J.League titles in 2012 and 2013. His exquisite passing skills and knack of being in the right place at the right time have made him an influential player who can shut down opposition forwards and then quickly turn defence into attack.  Aoyama has spent his entire professional career with Sanfrecce, where the football of choice is a fluid passing game. Since 2006, he has been used as a deep-lying midfielder in a role reminiscent of Italian midfield general Andrea Pirlo.  The 28-year-old has overcome several major setbacks during his career. A broken leg wrecked his 2007 season, during which Hiroshima was relegated to the second division. He was a central figure in qualifying for the 2008 Beijing Olympics but was omitted from the tournament squad, and another serious injury curtailed his 2009 season. Nevertheless, Aoyama continued to produce reliable performances and has been integral to Sanfrecce\u2019s success in recent years.  The hard-working defensive midfielder made his international debut against China PR at the 2013 East Asian Cup, and his penchant for making interceptions and his accurate passing could be vital if he gets on the field in Brazil. "}, {"Hotaru YAMAGUCHI": "Despite his modest stature, Hotaru Yamaguchi has developed into one of Japan\u2019s finest defensive midfielders through a combination of on-field commitment, high work rate and inspiring leadership.  A product of the Cerezo Osaka youth programme, where he was so highly regarded that he was often named team captain, Yamaguchi initially struggled to get game time after breaking into the senior team. However, since 2011, the 23-year-old has become a key player at the J.League club.  Yamaguchi gained further recognition when he appeared in every minute of Japan\u2019s campaign at the 2012 London Olympics, where they narrowly missed out on a medal. His sterling performances were a major factor in his side reaching the semi-finals for the first time in 44 years and firmly established him as the leading Japanese holding midfielder of his generation. Yamaguchi was one of several young players called up by coach Alberto Zaccheroni for the East Asian Cup in July 2013, and he repaid the faith shown in him by being selected as the tournament\u2019s most valuable player as Japan were crowned champions.  Despite his obvious qualities, Yamaguchi is not guaranteed a starting position at the FIFA World Cup\u2122 in Brazil. The Samurai Blue have an embarrassment of riches in the deep-lying midfielder position, where captain Makoto Hasebe and Yasuhito Endo - Japan\u2019s most capped player - are among those Yamaguchi will be trying to dislodge. "}, {"Makoto HASEBE": "Defensive midfielder Makoto Hasebe is the national team captain and a poster boy for Japanese football.  Hasebe was originally deployed in a playmaking role, at times just behind the front two, at his first club, Urawa Red Diamonds. His sublime dribbling skills and precision passing, along with a knack of popping up in attack, have since made Hasebe a fixture with the Samurai Blue.  Although Hasebe contributed to Urawa picking up domestic silverware and also winning the AFC Champions League in 2007, he missed out on selection for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany\u2122. In 2008, he was signed by German club Wolfsburg, where he operated primarily as a holding midfielder, but also occasionally as a defender and wide midfielder. In his second season, Wolfsburg won the Bundesliga title, with Hasebe frequently in the thick of the action.  The player\u2019s growing list of achievements soon became impossible for then Japan coach Takeshi Okada to ignore. Hasebe became a regular in the national side and was appointed captain for South Africa 2010. There the midfield linchpin ushered Japan through a tough group containing the Netherlands, Denmark and Cameroon, and his inspiring efforts at this tournament saw him become the face of the Japanese team.  Hasebe has retained the armband under coach Alberto Zaccheroni and is integral to Japan\u2019s chances in Brazil. The 30-year-old is a voracious reader and spends much of his time with his nose buried in a book.  "}, {"KIM Bokyung": "Kim Bokyung is an all-around midfielder who can deliver precise crosses from the left flank or dissect the opposition defence with inch-perfect through balls from the middle of the park. His involvement with the new generation of players under the guidance of Hong Myungbo began in 2009, when Kim took part in the FIFA U-20 World Cup Egypt. He helped the Taeguk Warriors reach the quarter-finals, scoring goals against the USA and Paraguay, although he could not feature in the last eight encounter with eventual champions Ghana due to suspension.\\r\\nAffectionately dubbed 'the left-footed maestro' after his heroics at Egypt 2009, Kim was called up to Korea's senior national team in the buildup to the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122. Although he was an unused substitute at the competition, the slim midfielder returned to Korea Republic\u2019s U-23 national team to help Hong\u2019s charges finish third at the Asian Games in Guangzhou. Kim went on to participate in the 2012 Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament, where he scored the winner against Switzerland during the group stage. The Taeguk Warriors eventually won the bronze medal for the first time, and the 24-year-old subsequently earned a move to Cardiff City that summer. "}, {"HA Daesung": "Ha Daesung is a dynamic midfielder with enormous work rate and delicate ball control. Although he began his professional career at Ulsan Hyundai in 2004, Ha could only make his debut after moving to Daegu two years later. He had made a name for himself as an attacking midfielder by the time he was transferred to Jeonbuk Motors in 2009, but it was in the following season that Ha finally proved himself at his new club, FC Seoul. He was selected among the Best XI of the 2011 K.League, before captaining the capital club to winning the national championship in 2012. He finished runners-up with the Seoulites at the AFC Champions League last year, before moving to Chinese outfit Beijing Guoan at the start of this season.\\r\\nHa won his first cap in a friendly with Qatar on 14 November 2008, and also took part in two matches during the final round of qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 under the guidance of Choi Kanghee.

At the age of 16, he had an opportunity to join the Korean FA\u2019s overseas programme and try his luck at German Bundesliga side Hamburg's youth setup in 2008. His eye-catching performances at the FIFA U-17 World Cup Nigeria 2009, where he scored three goals to help Korea Republic reach the quarter-finals, earned him a contract with Hamburg the following season.\\r\\nSon became his country\u2019s fourth youngest player to be called up to the national team ahead of the 2011 AFC Asian Cup in Qatar, where he opened his account against India during the group stage. But the left-winger chose not to take part in the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament the following year to focus on his professional career in the Bundesliga. This bold decision paid dividends in his final season at Hamburg as Son scored 12 goals in 33 matches, before signing a five-year contract with Bayer Leverkusen last summer. He went on to score his first hat-trick in a 5-3 win over his former club on 9 November 2013, becoming the first South Korean to achieve the feat in Germany.\\r\\nAlthough he made nine appearances over the course of the third and fourth round of Asian Zone qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, Son could not find the back of the net as the Taeguk Warriors fell to narrow defeats against Lebanon and Iran on the road. But despite being mainly used as a second-half substitute, he rose to the occasion in the next match against Qatar scoring the 96th-minute winner to seal a 2-1 victory in Seoul.

At the age of 20 he began his professional career with Japanese outfit Shonan Bellmare, where he stayed for three seasons before making a move to Kashiwa Reysol earlier this year. Despite lacking a muscular physique, Han makes up for it with timely intervention and neat tackles to establish himself as one of the most reliable lynchpins in midfield. However, the 24-year-old has gone through difficult times before making the Korea Republic squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122. He was a member of the national team that narrowly came short of reaching the second round of the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2007. Although he played a vital role for Hong\u2019s charges in qualifying for the 2012 Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament, Han had to leave London just before the tournament kicked off due to an injury sustained in the build-up to the finals.

These are generally young attacking talents who surprise unsuspecting opponents with their pace and trickery, making a difference when it matters most. Think Jesus Arellano at France 1998, Andres Guardado at Germany 2006 and Pablo Barrera at South Africa 2010. Isaac Brizuela looks like being the one to watch at Brazil 2014. Nicknamed (Little Rabbit) owing to his diminutive figure and zippy movement, the Toluca schemer is the sort of player who is capable of pulling something special out of the hat at any time. Fast, canny in possession and with a knack for producing piledrivers from outside the box, he has taken the Liga MX by storm over the last year. The\\xa0ideal man to find a way past a tight defence or turn things around when all looks lost, the stage is set for the 23-year-old\\xa0diamond in the rough to have an impact in this summer's tournament. What's more, given Mexico's recent record, no one should be surprised if this ace up coach Miguel Herrera's sleeve comes up trumps. "}, {"Javier AQUINO": "A gold medallist at the Men's Olympic Football Tournament London 2012, Javier Aquino is regarded as one of the most promising talents in Mexican football. The 23-year-old right-winger has enjoyed a rapid rise, and is now an established senior international for Mexico under Jose Manuel de la Torre. \\xa0 Aquino is a product of the youth system at Cruz Azul, the club for whom he also made his professional debut. After three years in the Mexican top flight he moved to Spain to join Villareal, where he quickly earned a place in the starting line-up. \\xa0 What Aquino lacks in height he makes up for in speed, dedication and trickery, with those attributes making him an important part of Mexico's tactical system. \\xa0 "}, {"Carlos PENA": "Nicknamed \u2018Gullit\u2019 due to his physical resemblance with the former Dutch star, Carlos Pena is one of the few genuine box-to-box midfielders in Mexican football. A product of the Pachuca youth academy, the 23-year-old has excelled since joining Leon, where he is a first team regular. \\r\\n\\r\\nPena\u2019s performances there have earned him recent call-ups to the national side, and he has shown promise in his initial forays on the international scene.\\r\\n \\xa0 The midfielder will travel to Brazil 2013 primarily to gain experience at a major tournament, although it would come as no surprise if coach Jose Manuel de la Torre were to bring him on at regular intervals throughout the competition.

Capable of maintaining his intensity over 90 minutes, thanks to his powerful legs, the indefatigable midfielder is also the tightest of markers and a skilled ball-winner.\\xa0\\r\\nThe Leon man brings fight and determination to a position that no one has been able to make their own in the Mexico side, and also has a perfect understanding with his club-mates Carlos Pena and Luis Montes, both of whom look set for starting places at Brazil 2014. It would come as no surprise, then, to see  coach Miguel Herrera put his faith in a midfield unit that has enjoyed no little success on the domestic scene in the last few seasons. "}, {"Nigel DE JONG": "A favourite of both Marco van Basten\u2019s and Bert van Marwijk\u2019s, Nigel de Jong has not always been considered an automatic starter since Louis van Gaal became Netherlands coach. It was only as the FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying campaign neared its conclusion that this tough and vastly experienced holding midfielder returned to the side as Van Gaal began to formulate his final plans for Brazil.  Few have ever questioned the ability of a player who has been operating at the top level in Europe for over a decade, starring for Ajax, Hamburg, Manchester City \u2013 where he cost \u00a318 million \u2013 and, most recently, AC Milan. At 29, De Jong also has plenty of first-rate\\xa0football ahead of him.  There have, though, been question marks over his discipline, with Van Marwijk famously suspending him from international duty after a typically fierce tackle while in action for City resulted in a leg-break for Hatem Ben Arfa. \"I have a problem,\u201d the then coach said, \u201cwith the way Nigel needlessly looks to push the limit.\"  However, critics of the midfielder\u2019s aggressive style of play often overlook the fact that, in his entire career, he has been red-carded only\\xa0once \u2013 and that was almost eight years ago, and for a second yellow card. At his best, De Jong remains one of the finest defensive midfielders in the game and could yet prove as influential for the in 2014 as he was at South Africa 2010.  "}, {"Jonathan DE GUZMAN": "Born and raised in Scarborough, Ontario, Jonathan de Guzman was widely expected to follow his older brother, Julian, by declaring his allegiance to his native Canada. Instead, and having joined Feyenoord\u2019s youth system at the tender age of 12, he opted for the Netherlands after gaining Dutch citizenship in 2008.  Opportunities to impress have been few and far between in the years since, but De Guzman did feature in the  2008 Olympic squad and has recently returned to the fold under Louis van Gaal. Three appearances during the team\u2019s qualifying campaign hardly mark him out as a regular, but the Villarreal midfielder \u2013 currently on loan at Swansea City \u2013 is among several staking a claim for greater involvement.  He has certainly made his mark in Wales, where his form over the past two seasons has helped cement Swansea\u2019s place in the English Premier League and secure the first major trophy of the club\u2019s history. Spectacular free-kicks continue to prove a speciality, while De Guzman\u2019s overall play has shown indications that he is rediscovering the sparkle that made him such a sought-after talent during his time with Feyenoord and Real Mallorca.  "}, {"Wesley SNEIJDER": "No player picked up more Man of the Match awards at the last FIFA World Cup\u2122 than Wesley Sneijder, adjudged the best player on show in four of the Netherlands\u2019 seven matches.\\xa0Nor were those\\xa0the only awards with which he returned from South Africa, with a runners-up medal accompanied by the adidas Silver Ball and Bronze Boot, reflecting his status as the tournament\u2019s second-best player and third-highest scorer.  Sneijder would also find himself on FIFA\u2019s Team of the Year, and named UEFA\u2019s best midfielder of 2010, and deserved no less for his performances in a truly extraordinary year for club and country. After all, while he fell just short of World Cup glory with the Netherlands, Sneijder picked up a collection of winner\u2019s medals for Inter Milan, most notably the coveted UEFA Champions League.  It was the culmination of the midfielder\u2019s increasingly spectacular rise from the precocious youngster first glimpsed in the famous red-and-white of Ajax at the age of 18. After establishing himself with the Amsterdam giants, winning seven trophies and earning a place in the national team, Sneijder departed for Real Madrid in 2007 for \u20ac27 million \u2013 making him the second-most expensive Dutchman in history.  This gifted playmaker impressed at times in Madrid, but a new wave of arrivals prompted to offload him to Inter for \u20ac15 million in 2009 \u2013 and how they would regret that decision. Sneijder went on to confirm his status as one of the finest midfielders in the world and, while his career has stalled a little since 2010 \u2013 with exile at Inter and a not entirely successful move to Galatasaray \u2013 the respect he holds among his team-mates is evident.  Indeed, when Louis van Gaal implied that he might not select the midfielder for Brazil 2014\\xa0due to his unconvincing club form, Arjen Robben\u2019s response was unequivocal. \"When he plays at his own level and is fully match fit, which he is now, Wesley is a player who brings something extra,\u201d said the Bayern Munich winger. \u201cYou need that at a World Cup. Wesley is an extraordinary player when he\\'s at his best and we have to take advantage of that. He still adds something to the .\"  "}, {"Jordy CLASIE": "One of several exciting talents to have come through the Feyenoord youth system over recent years, baby-faced Jordy Clasie is earning a formidable reputation for his mature midfield displays. Likened to both Xavi and Andrea Pirlo for his range of passing and ability to play with his head up, coolly assessing his options, the 22-year-old is already being linked with some of the top clubs in Europe.  Like Xavi, he is small and not particularly strong, but his sharp turns and use of the ball have established him as a regular for Feyenoord and won the admiration of Louis van Gaal. The Netherlands coach was impressed by Clasie\u2019s performances for the U-21s and called him into the senior squad, giving him his debut in a FIFA World Cup qualifier against Turkey that the Dutch won 2-0.  That was the first of five preliminary matches in which the youngster featured, and at no stage did he look out of place amid the household names elsewhere in the Dutch team. The tenacity he blends with his passing ability was evident for all to see, and Clasie will need to show that same side of his armoury as he attempts to win a place in Van Gaal\u2019s starting XI.  "}, {"Leroy FER": "Strong, quick and powerful, Leroy Fer was nicknamed (The Bouncer) even as a teenager for his impressive physical attributes. Now 24, the former Feyenoord and Twente midfielder has just completed his first full season in England\u2019s Premier League, becoming a fixture in the Norwich City line-up.  Indeed, while Norwich have struggled, the club\u2019s former manager Chris Hughton declared himself \u201cdelighted\u201d by the way in which Fer had made the transition from the less fast-and-furious Eredivisie. Nor has Hughton been the only manager impressed, with Liverpool\u2019s Brendan Rodgers said to be considering a summer bid, and Louis van Gaal having called on Fer several times since taking charge of the Netherlands.  Though not a regular in the national team, the big midfielder played in three of the FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifiers and is an option to provide the solidity required for the more expressive midfielders to strut their stuff. Fer is a product of the Dutch youth ranks, and a former captain of the national U-17 side, although it was only in 2009 that he finally declared his allegiances, having spoken openly of the temptation to turn out for his parents\u2019 home country of Netherlands Antilles.  "}, {"Georginio WIJNALDUM": "Georginio Wijnaldum took no time at all to make an impression as a Netherlands player, scoring just four minutes into his senior debut against San Marino in 2011. Opportunities have proved scarce in the time since, though, and the attacking midfielder failed to make a single appearance during the Oranje\u2019s FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying campaign.  Wijnaldum, though, is a player who has been tipped for stardom ever since moving to Feyenoord in 2007 and becoming the club\u2019s youngest-ever player, debuting in April of that year at the age of 16 years and 148 days. The youngster continued to impress across a variety of attacking midfield roles, and in 2011 PSV Eindhoven paid \u20ac5 million to prise him from Rotterdam.  Wijnaldum has been a regular in the PSV side ever since, and though not always hitting the heights expected earlier in his career, he remains a potent attacking weapon. Pace, technical ability and a willingness to run at defenders will certainly make him an exciting player to watch should Van Gaal utilise his abilities during the World Cup.  "}, {"Ejike UZOENYI": "A diminutive but quick winger capable of slicing through the attacking third with his pace and nimble dribbling abilities, Ejike Uzoenyi might prove to be a wild card in Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi\u2019s pack of players at the FIFA Confederations Cup. A true left-footed wide option in a team full of forwards and attacking midfielders, he has the potential to offer some instant offence or an introduction of width against a difficult to break down opponent. \\xa0 An experienced veteran of the Nigeria Premier League, Uzoenyi joined his compatriot Onyekachi Apam at French club Rennes on loan after the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations, but did not have time to make much impact during the second-half of this season. Although he made only one substitute appearance at the AFCON, the former Enyimba and Enugu Rangers player had done enough in Keshi\u2019s sides to draw attention from a variety of European clubs. He is most natural on the left side of midfield but can also be deployed on the right side if needed. "}, {"Ruben GABRIEL": "Kaduna-born Reuben Gabriel was one of a handful of local-based players called up by Super Eagles coach Stephen Keshi to Nigeria's 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations squad, and was an unused substitute as Nigeria won their third African title.  A tall and strong figure in the middle of the park, Gabriel joined Kilmarnock soon afterwards, but did not feature in many games for the Scottish Premier League club before a fall-out over the role he was playing. After a trial with Tottenham Hotspur, he signed for Belgian club Waasaland-Beveren. Again his first team opportunities have been sporadic as injuries ruled him out of action.   Gabriel played his first game for Nigeria in 2010 and scored his first goal for the Super Eagles two years later when he opened the scoring in a 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifier against Malawi \u2013 a game that ended in a 1-1 draw. He also played another game in Nigeria's qualifying campaign as the west Africans secured a second consecutive appearance on football's greatest footballing stage. Last year he had to rule himself out of Nigeria's FIFA Confederations Cup squad after picking up an injury. "}, {"John Obi MIKEL": "Although only 27-years-old, John Obi Mikel is one of the most experienced players in the Nigerian squad.  He first rose to prominence in 2005 when the then-18-year-old John Obi Mikel was awarded the Silver Ball at the FIFA World Cup U-20 Netherlands 2005. The only player at the tournament considered better than the Flying Eagles midfielder was a certain Lionel Messi.  Mikel was described in the tournament\\'s official report as an outstanding player with good vision, who can dictate pace and launch his side\\'s attacks. Fast-forward nine years, and the authors have been proven right, even though Mikel is asked to do far less for his star-studded club side Chelsea than he is with Nigeria, where he has long been thought of as having the potential to change the national team\\'s fortunes.\\r\\nIn fact, despite an up-and-down history with the Super Eagles, Mikel has been a key inspiration behind Nigeria\\'s resurgence under coach Stephen Keshi. He was a cool but driving presence in Nigeria\\'s midfield as they won their third CAF Africa Cup of Nations last year, finally fulfilling all of his promise as an all-action midfielder that could not only stop opponents, but create chances quickly in the other direction.  In 2010, a knee injury forced Mikel out of Nigeria\\'s 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 squad, so he is particularly eager to perform well in Brazil and showcase his talents. Mikel has won just about everything there is to win with Chelsea, including the Premier League, the FA Cup, the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Champions League. He described winning the latter as the \"best night of my life\u201d, but a run deep into the World Cup is sure to lay claim to that title. "}, {"Ramon AZEEZ": "If 21-year-old Ramon Azeez sees any playing-time in Brazil, he will have completed the hat-trick of FIFA tournaments. The midfielder was a regular in Nigeria's U-17 side that finished runner-up at the world championships in 2009, which the west Africans hosted. Two years later he played at the U-20 World Cup in Colombia as Nigeria advanced to the quarter-finals, where they were knocked out by France. At that stage, Azeez was already playing his club football in Spain, with UD Almeria. Azeez was born in the Nigerian capital of Abuja and came through the ranks at the Future Pro Academy, before agreeing to join the Spanish club in 2010. The transfer took nearly a year to be completed, but he finally moved to Europe in July 2011 and started playing for the Almeria B side that was competing in the Segunda Division B.  After learning the ropes in the reserve side for two seasons he was promoted to the first team at the start of the 2013/4 season and featured in 30 league matches. He scored two goals, both of which proved to be match-winners, during the season in which the club escaped relegation on the last day of the league. He played his first senior international in a friendly against Mexico in March and after being included in Stephen Keshi's extended World Cup squad kept his place to board the Brazil-bound plane. "}, {"Ogenyi ONAZI": "A young midfielder with a bright future, Ogenyi Onazi first caught the eye at the FIFA U-17 World Cup finals in 2009, when he helped Nigeria reach the final. Still just 21-years-old, Onazi plays with great quickness and skill but has proved to be no soft touch despite his smaller size \u2013 making him capable of playing in either the defensive or attacking third.  He joined Lazio in 2011 and impressed to such an extent that he has featured regularly in the clubs' Serie A matches. He also stood out during Nigeria\u2019s CAF Africa Cup of Nations triumph last year, playing a versatile role alongside Jon Obi Mikel that allowed the Super Eagles ample attacking thrust to keep moving forward.\\r\\nDespite being tipped as one of Nigeria's biggest emerging stars, Onazi failed to get any playing time at last year's FIFA Confederations Cup. However, he was called up for all but two of Nigeria's 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifiers, playing in six. The midfielder is definitely a player for the future and he has been consistently linked with large clubs throughout Europe, particularly in the English Premier League. "}, {"Miguel VELOSO": "Successful football families are nothing new, and Miguel Veloso belongs to just such a clan. Son of Antonio Veloso, the former Portugal international and Benfica captain, Miguel tried his luck at the same club but was rejected as a youngster because he was considered overweight. At 13 he switched to Lisbon rivals Sporting, and it was when he was wearing the green and white that Veloso made his mark.  His senior debut for Sporting came at the start of 2006/07 and it did not take long for his exceptional talent and a magical left foot to turn heads, putting in a man-of-the-match performance in a UEFA Champions League match against Inter Milan in the same season. A national call-up duly followed, in the qualification phase for Euro 2008 and he made the squad that went to Austria and Switzerland, playing in one match.  His pinpoint passing and accurate shooting gradually made him more of a regular for , and he played two matches in the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122. Upon Paulo Bento\u2019s appointment as Portugal manager Veloso became a mainstay of the team in front of the defence.

Always one step ahead of his peers, William was born in Angola, went to Portugal as a boy and did not waste time in showing he was a footballer of the highest calibre.  After watching him play for minnows Clube Mira Sintra, Benfica tried to sign him, but William was from a family of Sporting supporters so he preferred to bide his time and wait for the green and whites to come calling. And so they did. Aurelio Pereira, the scout who had brought talents such as Luis Figo, Simao Sabrosa, Nani and Cristiano Ronaldo to the Alvalade, presented the club with a new diamond.  In contrast to his illustrious predecessors, it is not on the wings that William shines, and speed is not his number one asset. An imposing physical presence, William is a brilliant holding midfielder, showing calmness and maturity beyond his 22 years.  After a year and a half on loan at Belgian outfit Cercle Brugge, he was a surprise inclusion in Sporting\u2019s first-team squad ahead of the 2013/14 season, but after a handful of matches nobody doubted his ability. He was simply sensational in Leonardo Jardim\u2019s team and also played an important role in helping Portugal win the World Cup play-off. The quality and talent of William Carvalho can now be witnessed on the biggest stage of all, at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122.\\xa0 "}, {"Joao MOUTINHO": "From the moment Joao Moutinho made his debut for Sporting at just 17 years of age in 2004/05, it was obvious that the diminutive midfielder was a very special player. His mature performances belied his age and the following years would see him cement his reputation as one of the world\u2019s top midfielders.  The next season he was an undisputed starter for Sporting, showing what would become trademark features of his game: metronomic consistency and a tireless engine. Moutinho played every minute of the 2005/06 league campaign, and would repeat the feat in subsequent seasons, never playing fewer than 35 games a year.\\xa0  At 19 he was named a vice-captain of Sporting and one year later he took over the captain's armband, thereby becoming a symbol of the Lisbon club. At just 20 years of age Moutinho was the second youngest captain in the long history of the Lisbon club, behind only the legendary Francisco Stromp.  So when news broke that he had transferred to domestic rivals Porto in the summer of 2010 it exploded like a bombshell in Portugal. And it was playing for the Oporto outfit that the trophies befitting a player of his calibre arrived. In his very first season for Porto he won it all: the Portuguese Super Cup, Championship and Cup, and the UEFA Europa League.  Porto\u2019s fans immediately took him to their hearts, and he propelled the team to the national championship in each of his three seasons in northern Portugal. By now, and despite his surprise omission from the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122, he was one of the bedrocks of  \\r\\nHe played a starring role at UEFA EURO 2012 where Portugal reached the semi-final, and was an undisputed starter in the qualifying campaign for the 2014 World Cup.

But it was on the road to South Africa 2010 that the midfielder cemented his place. He started all 12 qualifying games for the 2010 World Cup, as well as playing every match in the tournament.

His precocious talent did not go unnoticed, and just over two years later the midfielder had become a CSKA Moscow idol and made his Russia debut under Guus Hiddink.  His numerous goals and assists, not to mention sublime dribbling, cemented a meteoric rise that saw him voted Young Player of the Year in Russia in 2008. In the following years he played a decisive role in winning the Russian Championship, four Russian Cups and two Super Cups. Having established himself as a CSKA star at 20 years of age, he also earned his spot in the national team, even after Hiddink was replaced by Dick Advocaat. With the latter at the helm he stood out in the UEFA EURO 2012 qualifying campaign and shined brightly in the tournament itself, netting three goals (two against the Czech Republic and one against Poland), finishing as one of the event\u2019s top scorers.

The then 18-year-old joined FC Aarau in 2005 after failing to make a single first-team appearance for Basel. The holding midfielder, who also made an appearance for Turkey\u2019s U-21 team, developed into a true leader at Aarau and was a key factor in their Swiss Super League survival in 2006. After just one season at the club, however, Inler signed for FC Zurich where he won two consecutive championships in 2006 in 2007.  He then moved on to Serie A outfit Udinese, before signing for Napoli after four years with the It did not take Inler long to settle at the Stadio San Paolo either, winning the Coppa Italia in his first season with the club. He made his Switzerland debut in 2006, having opted against playing for the full Turkish national team. Under the guidance of Jakob Kuhn, Inler managed to nail down a regular starting berth and a place in the squad for UEFA EURO 2008.  Ottmar Hitzfeld, who took over from Kuhn as the coach in 2008, is also a keen admirer of Inler\u2019s talents and relied heavily on the midfielder at South Africa 2010. Hitzfeld even named him captain on 23 April 2011 after former skipper Alexander Frei had announced his retirement from international football. The 29-year-old has certainly repaid the faith shown in him by Hitzfeld, appearing in every 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifier and playing a major role in Switzerland\u2019s successful campaign.

Able to dictate the pace of a game with his use of the ball and a constant goal threat, these qualities have made coach Ottmar Hitzfeld liken him to another midfield maestro: \u201cI see a lot of similarities between Granit and Bastian Schweinsteiger, whom I brought to FC Bayern Munich as an 18-year-old.\u201d Spending his childhood and early teen years at Concordia Basel and later FC Basel respectively, it soon became clear Xhaka was a special talent, and it was no surprise when he broke into to the Basel first team. After two successful seasons at the St. Jakob Park outfit, he transferred to Monchengladbach, signing a five-year deal in 2012. The midfield schemer made his senior international debut on 4 June 2011 in a UEFA EURO 2012 qualifier against England at Wembley, having accumulated vast experience in the national youth set-up. This included victory at the FIFA U-17 World Cup Nigeria 2009 and second place at the UEFA U-21 European Championship 2011. At the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 he could forge a central-midfield partnership with Bayern\u2019s Xherdan Shaqiri, although he may face stiff competition for a starting spot from Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s Pirmin Schwegler.

An unused substitute in Uruguay's two opening 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 qualifiers, Gargano started the third match and was first-choice thereafter. His run in the starting line-up was interrupted by injury in early 2009, but he soon returned to the side and played in all four of their remaining fixtures. A further injury ruled him out of 's decisive play-off against Costa Rica, but he nonetheless made it into Tabarez's squad for the world finals. His only start at South Africa 2010, however, came in the semi-finals, and he was later used as a substitute for most of the 2011 Copa America.

With his dreadlocks bouncing around the middle of the pitch, he is strong in the tackle and has good vision, atttributes which go a long way in making up for a lack of pace.\\r\\nHe has become a fans' favourite for Major League Soccer outfit Real Salt Lake, where he ably captains the side. Since his arrival in 2007, the previously unfashionable club has won a league title and twice more reached the championship-deciding MLS Cup. A five-time MLS all-star, he also played a decisive role in the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, when he marshaled an experimental USA side to silverware on home soil from a deep-lying midfield role.  Coach Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s assessment of Beckerman couldn\u2019t gleam more brightly: \u201cHe\u2019s the model professional. He\u2019s totally committed and focused. Every time he steps on the field you know what you\u2019ll get.\u201d Beckerman himself seems to count his predictability and dependability as one of his top assets. \u201cI take pride in being consistent and steady,\u201d he told .\\xa0 \u201cA coach knows what he\u2019ll get from me.\u201d "}, {"Julian GREEN": "This attacking midfielder is arguably the most surprising selection of the whole 2014 FIFA World Cup.

After a season-long loan at third division outfit Vizela, he returned to the Minho-based side, playing a key role in their promotion to the top flight in 2012. The rangy striker\u2019s Portuguese Primeira Liga displays did not escape the attention of FC Porto, who added him to their squad in the summer of 2013, and it was not long before he won his first major trophy, the Portuguese Super Cup.  Ghilas has followed in the footsteps of his elder brother Kamel, who took part in Algeria\u2019s qualifying matches for South Africa 2010. The younger sibling was called up for the North Africans\u2019 Brazil 2014 qualifiers, gaining his first cap and also scoring in a 3-1 victory over Benin.

The sprightly attacking midfielder got his big break towards the end of that season, taking part in a handful of French Ligue 2 fixtures while still 17 years of age. The season after that, three goals, 26 appearances and series of impressive outings saw Grenoble promoted to French Ligue 1 and comparisons drawn between the young Algerian and Zinedine Zidane. The following campaign, he played a crucial role in Grenoble\u2019s successful battle to beat the drop. The ambitions of the rising North African star were then dealt a severe blow by a knee injury that sidelined him for most of the 2009/10 season, towards the end of which he signed for Valencia. After recuperating and enjoying a short loan spell with Almeria, Feghouli would, over the next three years, become one of the stars of \u2019s starting XI, putting in top-notch displays in La Liga, the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. It did not take long for the Algerian international set-up to take an interest in the cultured playmaker, and he received his first cap for  in a CAF Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Gambia in February 2012, a match in which he also scored his first international goal. Voted Algerian Footballer of the Year in 2012, the beguiling No10 appeared in three matches at the 2013 Cup of Nations in South Africa.

The forward topped the scoring charts for his side during qualifying, hitting five goals in seven games. After starting out in the youth ranks at Ain Benian, Slimani began his senior career with third-division Cheraga, for whom he struck 18 times in 20 matches. His prowess in front of goal persuaded Belouizdad to bring him on board in May 2009, and Slimani went on to spend four seasons with the club, helping them reach the Algerian Cup final in 2012. The Algiers native first earned international recognition when he was called up by Abdelhak Benchikha for Algeria's B squad, and although he was not given playing time, his breakthrough was not long in coming. Slimani proved his worth in the qualifiers for Brazil 2014 and tied down a starting spot at the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations, where he contested all three of Algeria's games without finding the net.  Now firmly established in his country's starting line-up, the striker continued his progress by signing for Sporting Lisbon last summer, marking his first season in Portugal by plundering a number of important goals. "}, {"El Arabi SOUDANI": "El Arabi Hillel Soudani has forged a reputation as one of the most effective Algerian forwards of recent times, most notably finishing top scorer in the Algerian championship with 18 goals in 25 games in 2010/11. Those efforts helped Chlef clinch the league title, and Soudani also weighed in with three strikes as Algeria finished fourth at the 2011 CAF African Nations Championship. The striker began his career with Chlef at the age of 19 in 2006, and two years later he was voted the best young talent in the Algerian top flight. After catching the eye at the African Nations Championship, he then agreed a deal to join Vitoria Guimaraes, lifting the Portuguese Cup in 2013 during his two-year stay. Soudani left Guimaraes for Dinamo Zagreb last summer, helping the club win the Croatian Super Cup soon after his arrival. He quickly proved his worth for his new side, contributing a number of important goals on domestic duty and in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Champions League. On the international stage, Soudani's excellent displays for Algeria's B team earned him a senior call-up in June 2011 to face Morocco. He represented his country at the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations, finding the net against C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and he continued his progress during qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, notching important strikes against Rwanda and Mali.

Indeed, the attacking midfielder\u2019s skilful displays have earned him the nickname \u2018The Algerian Messi\u2019 over the past few years. Following an initial season with his home-town club, ES Setif, he embarked on loan stints at El Eulma and at El Harrach. Upon returning to Setif, the talented playmaker lifted the Algerian Cup \u2013 a competition in which he finished top scorer \u2013 and was named Algerian Footballer of the Year for the 2011/12 campaign. In the summer of 2012, he committed himself to Tunisian giants Club Africain, with whom he topped the league scoring charts. Djabou gained his first taste of international football with Algeria at the CAF African Nations Championship in 2011, where the Desert Foxes reached the semi-finals.

The winger secured his spot thanks to his excellent performances for Leicester City, having joined the English club in January. Born in 1991, the pacy wide man began his career with Quimper before moving to Le Havre, where he signed his first professional terms. He then made his debut for the Normandy outfit's first team against Angers in July 2011. After making 34 French Ligue 2 appearances for Le Havre during the 2012/13 campaign, the 23-year-old opted for a taste of English football, joining Leicester at the start of the year. Scoring three goals in 19 outings and quickly emerging as a key figure for the side, he helped Leicester clinch their return to the English Premier League. "}, {"Gonzalo HIGUAIN": "How would Gonzalo Higuain's career have panned out had he accepted then France coach Raymond Domenech's invitation to feature in a friendly for Les Bleus back in 2006? There is no way of knowing, but one thing we do know for sure is that the France-born forward \u2013 who always dreamed of playing for Argentina \u2013 would have scored goals whoever he represented.\\r\\nThough his father, Jorge Nicolas Higuain, was a footballer, Gonzalo is far from a chip off the old block. While dad was an uncompromising defender nicknamed Pipa (The Pipe) because of his prominent nose, Pipita (Little Pipe) is a fox in the box \u2013 a natural No9 who relies on his pace and sharp instincts to always be in the right place at the right time. He can set up goals as well as finish with both feet and his head.\\r\\nHiguain enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top, moving to Real Madrid as a teenager, just 35 appearances and 13 goals after making his River Plate debut in 2005. Following a short teething period, his class soon came to the fore, allowing him to hold his own amid competition from the likes of Raul, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Rafael van der Vaart and Karim Benzema. He lifted six trophies in Madrid \u2013 his most prolific season came in 2009/10, when he hit the target 29 times in 40 games \u2013 and has continued to bang in the goals since joining Napoli in 2013.\\r\\nHaving not represented Argentina at youth level, the sharpshooter had to bide his time before making the international breakthrough. Overlooked for the 2007 Copa America and that year's FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada, he finally got a call-up in 2009, though he previously turned out for the U-23 side. Diego Maradona handed him his first cap in a 2010 FIFA World CupTM qualifier against Peru and he duly got on the scoresheet. Higuain started all five games in South Africa, netting four times during Argentina's run to the quarter-finals. He has been a fixture in the team under current coach Alejandro Sabella, finishing as the country's second top scorer on the road to Brazil 2014 with nine goals. As such, Sabella will be banking on the Napoli predator and his deadly partnership with Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero to fire the to the trophy this summer. "}, {"Lionel MESSI": "Such has been the praise that Lionel Messi has attracted during the course of his stellar career that there is not much more that can be said about him. Reflecting on that problem, his current national team coach Alejandro Sabella said: \u201cIt\u2019s got to the stage where you have to invent a new adjective for him.\u201d  \\r\\nBlessed with eagle-eyed vision, sublime technique and lightning acceleration, the left-footed wizard patrols the area in and around the box, detecting defensive chinks that are invisible to mere mortals. His gift for shifting through the gears, skipping past opponents and finding the back of the net, both from open play and dead-ball situations, has brought him so many goals that it is easier to list the records he has yet to break than the ones that have already fallen to him. \\r\\nThe story of his early days has become the stuff of legend. Born in Rosario, he played for Newell\u2019s Old Boys\u2019 youth teams before moving to Spain at the age of 13 and earning a trial with Barcelona. \u201cI spotted him straightaway,\u201d said Carles Rexach, the head of the  youth set-up at the time. \u201cAs a symbolic gesture, I made him sign for the club on the back of a napkin.\u201d \\r\\nNicknamed  (The Flea) on account of his slight frame, Messi underwent growth hormone treatment, with every effort being made to nurture and prepare him for his ascension to the first team. Since making his debut against Espanyol in 2004, Messi has won trophy after trophy with \\xa0and a succession of individual awards, including four consecutive FIFA Ballons d\u2019Or. \\r\\nHis well-documented international career began with him top-scoring as Argentina won the FIFA U-20 World Cup Netherlands 2005, though his senior debut later that year proved to be an inauspicious one, Messi being sent off only 47 seconds after coming on in a friendly against Hungary. Further frustration came when he watched from the bench as  \\xa0went out to the hosts on penalties in the quarter-finals at Germany 2006, a setback followed by defeat to Brazil in final of the 2007 Copa America. There would be a happier outcome in the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament at Beijing 2008, where Messi contributed to his country\u2019s gold-medal win.  \\r\\nThough much was expected of him at South Africa 2010, he failed to score as Argentina fell in the last eight again. Since then, however, he has become his country\u2019s second-highest goalscorer of all time, overtaking Hernan Crespo and Diego Maradona, his coach in South Africa, in the process. An object of criticism from some  fans in the past, Messi has been attracting plenty of praise since the appointment of Sabella, who has elevated him to the captaincy and built the team around him. With ten goals,  was his country\u2019s leading scorer in the qualifiers for Brazil 2014. \\r\\nWhile his status as one of the greatest players ever to walk the Earth is not in question, Messi is intent on winning a World Cup and safeguarding his legacy as an all-time legend. Following an up-and-down season with his club, during which he has been hampered by injury, he heads to Brazil rested and determined to achieve his goal.

After trying his luck with Real Betis in Spain two years later, he signed for Banfield, spending six months there before joining the mighty Boca Juniors at the start of 2005. \\r\\nHis stop-start international career began that same year, when Jose Pekerman selected him for a friendly in March. Though he did not make the trip to the FIFA Confederations Cup in Germany and was hardly used in the qualifiers for Germany 2006, Palacio did make the squad for the world finals, where he played one game. \\r\\nDespite collecting the adidas Bronze Ball at the FIFA Club World Cup Japan 2007 and staying in among the goals with Boca, Palacio virtually disappeared from the  set-up thereafter. His return came when Alejandro Sabella took over, by which time he was enjoying his most productive season with Genoa. The front man has since moved on to Inter Milan, where he has become a first-team regular.\\xa0Sabella has kept the player in his plans, using him in eight Brazil 2014 qualifiers, during which Palacio scored one goal. "}, {"Sergio AGUERO": "Sergio Aguero has been making a splash from day one, having become the youngest player to feature in the Argentinian top flight when he made his debut for Independiente in 2003 at the age of 15 years, one month and three days.\\xa0, as he is nicknamed after a Japanese anime character, is a prolific forward who loves running at defenders. He is equally at home leading the line or in a support role, as evidenced by his potent partnership with Lionel Messi and Gonzalo Higuain at international level. Aguero was still young enough to represent the Argentina U-17s when he won the 2005 FIFA U-20 World Cup in the Netherlands, where he played a bit-part role off the bench. Though Jose Pekerman decided against taking him to the 2006 FIFA World CupTM in Germany, his successor, Alfio Basile, handed the prodigy his first senior cap later that year. Still, his real breakthrough tournament was his second U-20 World Cup, Canada 2007, where he captained the team to glory, scoring six times along the way and scooping the adidas Golden Ball and Golden Shoe awards. This was the cue for Aguero to step it up a level at Atletico Madrid, where he had been eased into the team following a big-money move the previous year. He crowned a great second season at the club with his performances at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, bagging a brace against Brazil in the semi-finals as Argentina took gold. The tricky forward was\\xa0practically ever-present in qualifying for South Africa 2010, netting four times. The tournament itself, however, was a different story. Though he had given his then father-in-law Diego Maradona his first grandson in 2009, Aguero was less productive on the pitch under the Argentinian legend's stewardship, failing to break his duck in three appearances at the finals. Following the 2011 Copa America, the forward joined English side Manchester City, where he enjoyed his most prolific season to date. He capped the campaign by scoring arguably the most important goal of his career \u2013 a last-gasp effort that sealed City's first title in 44 years. Aguero has been a mainstay of the  set-up under Alejandro Sabella. However, he only forced his way into the starting line-up on the road to Brazil 2014 after coming off the bench to grab the winner against Colombia in the fourth round of fixtures. He established himself as a pivotal figure in the team's attacking play thereafter, scoring five times in eight qualifiers in all, and will be\\xa0hoping to\\xa0spearhead Argentina's\\xa0bid for glory\\xa0this summer.

He tried his luck again two years later with third division side Club Atletico Estudiantes and decided to make a go of it.\\xa0A speedy forward and elusive dribbler, his sudden changes in pace and improving finishing skills make Lavezzi a handful for any defence. \\r\\nAfter a fleeting stay with Genoa in 2004 he signed for San Lorenzo, winning a league title with them in 2007, at which point he returned to Italy, this time to Napoli. A firm favourite with the fans at the San Paola, he then moved on for a big fee to Paris Saint-Germain, where he has become an integral part of the side. \\r\\nIt was in 2007 that Alfio Basile gave him his national-team debut, and though he did not feature in the Copa America in Venezuela that year, he made the trip to Beijing 2008 and scored twice in Argentina\u2019s Olympic gold-medal campaign. Though included in Diego Maradona\u2019s 30-man shortlist for South Africa 2010, Lavezzi failed to make the cut for the world finals. A fixture in Alejandro Sabella\u2019s plans since his appointment, Lavezzi appeared in eight of Argentina\u2019s Brazil 2014 qualifying matches and scored three goals in the process. "}, {"Tim CAHILL": "A tireless contributor and consistent goalscorer during his national team career, Tim Cahill\u2019s status among Australia\u2019s all-time greats has long been assured.  An ability to rise to the occasion when it matters was famously underlined at Germany 2006, when Cahill bagged a late double within a matter of minutes against Japan. The goals were Australia first-ever at a FIFA World Cup\u2122 and helped the Socceroos to their maiden win on the world stage, lifting Cahill\u2019s profile to stratospheric levels in his homeland. His goal against Serbia at South Africa 2010 \u2013 typically a dynamic headed strike \u2013 means Cahill is the only Australian to score at two World Cups.  Despite a modest build Cahill is surely one of the world\u2019s greatest exponents of the art of heading. An uncanny ability to time an impressive leap, combined with a considerable dose of heroism, has made Cahill a fans\u2019 favourite throughout his club and international career.  A double against Ecuador earlier this year lifted Cahill to 31 goals and past Damian Mori\u2019s long-standing national record.  However, it could have all been so different. Born in Sydney to a Samoan mother, Cahill briefly played for the Polynesians\u2019 U-20 team and was deemed ineligible to feature for the Socceroos until he was 24 following a change in FIFA\u2019s eligibility regulations in 2004.  Though a fiercely proud Australian, Cahill retains a strong connection to his Samoan heritage and has been known to occasionally celebrate a goal by mimicking a  stroke; Polynesian\u2019s popular canoe sport.  Cahill remains a highly regarded figure at Everton following eight years of consistent and loyal service at Goodison Park, which ended in 2012 with a move to New York Red Bulls. Late last year Cahill netted after just seven seconds in a match for New York,\\xa0considered to be the fastest goal in Major League Soccer history.  Cahill has mostly filled an attacking midfield role throughout his national team career, though increasingly in recent years he has been deployed as a central striker, including during Ange Postecoglou's era as coach.  "}, {"Mathew LECKIE": "Blessed with blistering pace, wide attacker Mathew Leckie is very much a player new Australia coach Ange Postecoglou has earmarked as a key component in the team\u2019s ongoing regeneration. Leckie is a direct running attacker who generally likes to play high on the right but is capable of slotting in anywhere across the frontline.  This season has been a breakthrough campaign of sorts for Leckie who has been a regular for Bundesliga 2 side FSV Frankfurt - alongside fellow national team player Nikita Rukavytsya - where he has been a first-team regular\\xa0and increased his goalscoring ratio considerably. Prior to joining Frankfurt, Leckie was at Borussia Monchengladbach though he made only a handful of Bundesliga appearances.  Though born in Melbourne, Leckie made his name in the A-League at Adelaide United under current Socceroos assistant coach Aurelio Vidmar. He made an immediate impact scoring a spectacular goal in just his second appearance.  Leckie made his international debut in late 2012 in an international against Korea Republic and has received intermittent calls-up to the national squad since then.  "}, {"Adam TAGGART": "A breakthrough A-League season with Newcastle Jets catapulted Adam Taggart into Brazil 2014 contention. At just 20 years of age Taggart netted 16 goals for the erratic Jets becoming the youngest player to take out the league\u2019s top goalscorer award, and just the second Australian to do so over the past six seasons. A classic No9 Taggart has a natural goalscorers instinct and when in form is deadly in and around the penalty area. He was the first choice striker for the Young Socceroos at last year\u2019s FIFA U-20 World Cup filling the central role in the same 4-2-3-1 formation favoured by Postecoglou.  He made his senior national team debut in late 2012 during East Asian Championship qualifying and his two goals against Chinese Taipei bizarrely tallied more than his A-League goalscoring record at that point.  One of numerous young players to have come out of Perth in recent years Taggart made the move from home-town club Perth Glory to Newcastle and, after a modest first season, blossomed alongside former England striker Emile Heskey.  "}, {"Ben HALLORAN": "Ben Halloran was at long odds to make Australia\u2019s Brazil 2014 squad a year ago. However, a breakthrough season in Germany, combined with the appointment of long-term admirer Ange Postecoglou changed all that.  Nevertheless, Halloran was an outside selection for the final 23-man roster having only made his international debut a few weeks prior to the FIFA World Cup\u2122 in Australia\u2019s final home match against South Africa.  Like several of his Socceroo team-mates Halloran is blessed with blistering pace, and normally slots in wide on the right where his direct running can unsettle defences.  Born in Cairns in Australia\u2019s remote north, Halloran grew up in Brisbane and made his senior start at nearby Gold Coast United. After making an immediate impression Halloran was head-hunted by several clubs, including Postecoglou\u2019s Melbourne Victory, before settling on a move to hometown club Brisbane Roar.

Alerted to his striking talents, major European clubs began to take an interest in the young phenomenon. However, keen to pursue his footballing apprenticeship and academic studies, he decided to remain with the Brussels outfit. It was in the summer of 2011 that the rapidly maturing Belgian finally moved abroad, joining Chelsea in a high-profile transfer. While delighted to be training alongside the likes of Didier Drogba, his childhood idol, Lukaku found playing time hard to come by at the London side. Loaned out to West Bromwich Albion and then Everton, he has proceeded to exhibit the same eye for goal that originally helped to make his name.

It would turn into a confidence-boosting move, as goals (20 in 25 matches during season 2011/12), trophies (two Greek titles and a Greek Cup) and individual recognition (2012 Greek Player of the Year award) soon followed.

Just 22 minutes separated Safet Susic\u2019s side with a play-off for a place in Brazil \u2013 a hurdle they had fallen at in the 2010 qualifiers \u2013 when the No9 did what he has done prolifically for his country, Hoffenheim and Stuttgart since 2007.  Ibisevic was brought up in Switzerland and the USA, where he played in the US Premier Development League. There, he caught the eye of Paris Saint-Germain coach and fellow Bosnian Vahid Halilhodzic, who took him to the French capital. The youngster was swiftly loaned out to Dijon and, when Halilhodzic vacated the PSG reins, Ibisevic joined the French second-tier team on a permanent basis.  The big forward failed to hit the heights at Dijon, Alemannia Aachen or in his first season at Hoffenheim, which ended with the club securing promotion to the Bundesliga. In his second term in Baden-Wurttemberg, however, Ibisevic electrified. His 18 goals in 17 league games had Hoffenheim implausibly sitting top in January before he was ruled out for the remained of the campaign and his team went into a rapid descent, ultimately finishing seventh.  Ibisevic continued to ripple nets for Hoffenheim before transferring to Stuttgart in January 2012, since which he has managed to average over a goal every two games.  The Bosnian footballer of the Year for 2008, Ibisevic, a predatory striker who links up fluently with Edin Dzeko, scored eight goals in ten Brazil 2014 qualifiers \u2013 including the only one in that historic match in Lithuania. "}, {"Edin DZEKO": "Edin Dzeko has long been Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2019s sporting poster boy.

It was not, however, always plain sailing for Dzeko. He started out as a midfielder for Zeljeznicar in his homeland, but the club considered him too burly for the position and he was allowed to join Czech side Teplice. Initially loaned out, Dzeko returned, was converted into a forward, and finished joint-second on the 2006/07 Gambrinus Liga scoring chart.\\r\\nThat return piqued the interest of Wolfsburg, and \u20ac4m took the player across the border. Dzeko made a good impression in his first campaign, helping a team that had just survived relegation the previous season run home in fifth, but he made an incredible one in his second. He finished it with 26 goals and ten assists in 32 Bundesliga games. Wolfsburg finished it with their first title. Moreover, Dzeko\u2019s 54-goal partnership with Grafite proved the deadliest in German top-flight history, surpassing the total Bayern Munich legends Gerd Muller and Uli Hoeness managed between them in 1971/72.  Dzeko left Wolfsburg for Manchester in January 2011 for \u20ac32m. The City No10 hit 14 Premier League goals in each of his first two full seasons, helping them win the FA Cup in 2010/11 and become national champions the following campaign.  After netting a stunning strike on his Bosnia-Herzegovina debut in 2007, Dzeko finished as the second-leading marksman in European qualifying for both South Africa 2010 and Brazil 2014.

It was as an impact substitute that Visca shone during 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifying. He helped them run out emphatic 5-0 winners in Latvia and, after he was summoned from the bench in the 69th minute in Slovakia, Bosnia-Herzegovina quickly turned a deficit into a decisive 2-1 victory.  Visca kicked off his career at Zeljeznicar, and the youngster\u2019s assists and goals propelled them to the Bosnian Premier League title in 2009/10 and the Bosnian Cup the following season. He joined Istanbul BB in 2011 and though they suffered Turkish Super Lig relegation in 2012/13, Visca played a big role in them bouncing back at the first time of asking.\\r\\nVisca made over 30 appearances for Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2019s youth sides, before making his full debut in 2010.

A direct, powerhouse of a centre- or wide-forward who knows his way around the box, Hulk started out in the youth ranks at Vilanovense and moved on to Sao Paulo before making his professional debut with Vitoria.  The player\u2019s future lay outside Brazil, however. After failing to make much of an impression at the Bahia state club he was loaned out to Japanese side Kawasaki Frontale and from there to second-division outfit Consadole Sapporo, where he scored 25 goals in 2006. The following season he was the Japanese second tier\u2019s top scorer, amassing 37 goals in 42 outings for Tokyo Verdy. Those statistics brought him a move to Europe in 2008, when he signed for Porto. After breaking into the national side and winning a string of trophies for the Portuguese giants, he then made a big-money move to his current club Zenit St. Petersburg. As the boy from Paraiba told , he has taken everything in his stride in his globe-trotting career: \u201cI can adapt pretty quickly to anything.

Quick to take full advantage was Fluminense target man Fred, who struck in each of  first three friendlies back in charge \u2013 against England, Italy and Russia. At the time the Russians were the only team in European Zone qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 yet to concede a goal. Far from getting carried away, however, like any good goal-getter Fred knows he must remain constantly alert, ready to sniff out the next chance to find the net, as his opponents witnessed during the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013 where he scored five goals. \\xa0\\xa0 \u201cNow, I\u2019ve been able to spend more time with  too and find out what he expects from the team.

And it is hardly surprising: in the  side\u2019s 2012 Brasileirao championship win, the No9 not only topped the divisional scorer\u2019s charts but was chosen as the competition\u2019s best player. With his classic, gutsy style of play, fighting against defenders and injuries, Fred developed a strong bond with the club. The striker, who spent four seasons in France playing for Lyon, tells  that \u201cif I was asked to see out the rest of my career here, I\u2019d sign up straight away\u201d. "}, {"NEYMAR": "Hailed as a prodigy since his early teens and a much-talked about figure on the international football scene for years now, Neymar would appear at first glance to be a seasoned veteran. Yet in real terms, we are still in the formative phase of the career of a striker who is, at the tender age of 22, already seen as  leading man. His ability with the ball at his feet, be it in exhilarating short dribbles or long mazy runs, is what strikes you most about the winner of the FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award for 2011\u2019s finest goal, along with a finalist for the same award in 2012 and 2013. But that is by no means the only way the versatile attacker can break down even the most stubborn of defences. Having evolved as a player year in year out, Neymar is also now a threat from distance with either foot, an adept penalty-area opportunist and a fine provider of chances for his team-mates, even in the tightest of situations. A complete package, the seemingly tireless front-runner is also the subject of frequent praise from coaches due to his impressive commitment to the game, whatever the occasion. Averaging two trophies a year with club side Santos in 2010, 2011 and 2012 \u2013 the highlights being wins in the 2010 Copa do Brasil and 2011 Copa Libertadores \u2013 Neymar, now a Barcelona star, was also a member of the Brazil squad that claimed silver at the Olympic Football Tournament London 2012. With his almost limitless potential, the fleet-footed forward is well aware of the expectations on his shoulders ahead of his first FIFA World Cup\u2122. \u201cThe pressure is really great. Wherever we play there\u2019s always pressure, but it\u2019s going to be even greater on home soil,\u201d he told\\xa0. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of that, but we enjoy it \u2013 it\u2019s a good type of pressure. I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to play in the finals of various championships, and feeling that pressure to win is marvellous. We\u2019re ready for all of that, as it\u2019s something Brazilian players take in their stride.\" "}, {"BERNARD": "Slender of frame and only 5\u20194 tall, Atletico Mineiro\u2019s Bernard has shown plenty of perseverance in making his way to the top, and no little talent on the ball either. \"It was a big obstacle for me and I think any kid my age would have given up,\u201d he told , in reference to his size and his early struggles, which saw him rejected twice by Atletico Mineiro before finally convincing the club to take him on at the age of 13. \u201cThe two times they sent me away I asked them if I could come back. All I wanted was to be a football player.\u201d Thanks to his ability on the ball, Bernard turned attention away from his lack of height. Loaned out to Democrata de Sete Lagoas, he starred in the second division of the Minas Gerais state championship, where his performances caught the eye of Atletico Mineiro coach Dorival Jr, who gave him his first chance in the first team. Further opportunities would come following the arrival of Cuca as coach in 2011, the youngster seizing them to cement his place in the first team and be named the best newcomer of the 2012 Brazilian championship season. He also won the Copa Libertadores 2013, an accolade that proved his stepping stone to a place in the Brazil squad, before moving to Ukraines\u2019 Shakhtar Donetsk.

He was more than ready for the job.  Even at the age of 27, the rangy forward still has plenty to prove in the game, despite having pulled on the jerseys of a host of big-name clubs at home and abroad. Indeed, his well-travelled footballing existence has been made possible by an early start, having made his professional debut for Corinthians at the age of just 16 years, three months and 29 days \u2013  youngest-ever debutant. The then-teenager caught the eye thanks to a rare combination of height (1.89m) and technique and, though still without the physical robustness of an old-fashioned No9, Jo was from the off adept at pulling wide and working the flanks. Now, some ten years on, he has also represented CSKA Moscow, Manchester City, Everton, Galatasaray and Internacional, as well as featuring for Brazil at the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament Beijing 2008.\\xa0 Retaining the ability to drop deep or into wide areas, Jo has improved his penalty-area prowess and has been thriving on the quality service of his Atletico-MG team-mates. The same happened in the FIFA Confederations Cup, in which he scored two goals even with reduced minutes, replacing Fred. "}, {"Alexis SANCHEZ": "Hailing from Tocopilla, a place nicknamed , Alexis Sanchez was perhaps always destined to be something special. Blessed with speed, superb dribbling ability and magnificent movement on the right flank, the 25-year-old is one of the undisputed stars of the Chilean national team. As a kid, playing played barefoot on the dirt pitches of his home town, he was known as  (the Squirrel), due to his scurrying movements. Rejected by both Colo Colo and Universidad Catolica, Alexis was given his chance by Cobreloa aged 15 and responded in style, making his debut in the Chilean top flight a year later under Nelson Acosta. By then, he\\xa0had already been dubbed\\xa0 (the wonder boy) both by his club and the Chile\\xa0U-17 team. Bought by Udinese, he was loaned back to Colo Colo and then River Plate, where he won two Chilean championships and an Argentinian title, respectively. Sanchez shone too for Chile at the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada, a competition which saw the emergence of the country\u2019s golden generation. By that time, he\\xa0was already part of the senior squad as well, having made his debut a year earlier, again under Acosta. On his return to at Udinese in 2008/09,\\xa0Sanchez struggled to begin with but Marcelo Bielsa kept faith in him for Chile and Alexis was ever-present as  finished second in the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 qualifiers and then made the last 16 at the tournament itself. Armed with that experience he went on to triumph in Udine too, forming a lethal partnership with Antonio Di Natale, his fantastic form earning him a move to Barcelona in 2011. As well as adding a number of titles to his collection, Sanchez has developed his game and matured in the Catalan capital, where he has featured on the left and as a centre-forward. Under Claudio Borghi and Jorge Sampaoli, he played 1,071 minutes on the way to Brazil 2014 and following a season of ups and downs for Bar\u00e7a, Chile hope he will be back to his brilliant best at the World Cup.

The penalty-box predator exploded onto the scene as an 18-year-old at Universidad de Chile, where his aerial prowess and goal threat immediately drew comparisons to the great Ivan Zamorano. Having previously represented Chile at U-17 and U-20 level, he was given his first full international cap by Juvenal Olmos in 2003, less than a year into his professional career. The hype only intensified when the then teenager was snapped up by Inter Milan, one of Zamorano's former clubs. However, immaturity and a string of injuries curtailed Pinilla's progress and the forward became a journeyman, bouncing between eight different clubs in four years. He resurrected his career at lower-league Italian outfit Grosseto, where his goalscoring form caught the eye of Palermo and sparked rumours of a potential international comeback, which eventually came about in 2011 under Claudio Borghi. He was recalled again in 2013, this time by Jorge Sampaoli, for a Brazil 2014 qualifying double-header. Another good season in Italy and the fact that he offers something different to most of Chile's other forwards secured his seat on the plane to Brazil. "}, {"Eduardo VARGAS": "Eduardo Vargas is another product of the union between Universidad de Chile and Jorge Sampaoli in 2011 and 2012, a partnership from which  still benefits today. Long regarded as a promising young player,  broke through and confirmed his considerable potential at . Vargas featured for the youth teams at Universidad Catolica and, at 15, even participated in a football reality show. He ended up signing for Cobreloa and moved from a centre-forward position to a wide role.

"}, {"Esteban PAREDES": "A record of 16 goals in 13\\xa0matches in this year's Clausura put Esteban Paredes back in contention for a place at the FIFA World Cup\u2122, amply vindicating the forward's decision to head back to Chile and rejoin Colo Colo ahead of Brazil 2014. The target man has only made one international appearance since mid-2013, and that was in a friendly. However, finishing as the top goalscorer in the league for the fourth time in his career was enough to earn the sharpshooter a second bite at the cherry on the world stage, having played twice at South Africa 2010. A product of the Santiago Morning academy, Paredes twice led the domestic scoring charts during his\\xa0years at his alma mater: in 2005, when the club won promotion to the top flight, and in 2009. He followed up the latter achievement by becoming a regular at international level under Marcelo Bielsa and making the big move to Colo Colo, where he endeared himself to the fans by helping the Santiago giants to the 2009 Clausura title.  After South Africa, Paredes top-scored in the 2011 Clausura and was taken to that year's Copa America in Argentina by Claudio Borghi. The marksman featured three times under both Borghi and his successor, Jorge Sampaoli, on the road to Brazil.

The 27-year-old has also been in the Elephants' squad at the last four CAF Africa Cup of Nations, missing the decisive penalty in the shoot-out in the 2012 final against Zambia.  A roadrunner on the flanks, Gervinho is capable of changing games, and when on form, of leaving any defence at sixes and sevens. He has also been accused of being erratic, and of finishing inconsistently when finding himself in front of goal.

Not surprisingly, he joined a European club immediately afterwards, when he signed for Valenciennes. Although he featured regularly for the French side, he failed to score many goals and at the beginning of the 2013/14 season he joined Lorient. The change led him to re-discover the scoring form for which he had been known in Cameroon. He played in almost every match in the league season, scoring just under a goal in every other match. \\r\\nAt the same time, he played his part in helping Cameroon to the finals in Brazil as he was called up for six of the country's qualifiers, playing in three of them. Aboubakar has a strong physical presence and being only 22, he is certainly a promising player for the future. Known for his acrobatic somersaults after scoring, he is being linked with a move to a much larger club after his breakout season in France. A goal or two on the world stage in Brazil will certainly do his exposure no harm. "}, {"Eric CHOUPO MOTING": "Although only 25, Eric Choupo-Moting can already look back at seven years of professional football at the highest level. The striker, who was born in Hamburg to a German mother and a Cameroonian father, played his first Bundesliga match as an 18-year-old in August 2007. After initially getting regular matches with\\xa0HSV, however,\\xa0he spent most of his time on the bench after the winter break and struggled in the following seasons. In the summer of 2009 he was loaned out to Nuremburg. It proved a shrewd move and despite playing in an unfamiliar role on the left wing, he weighed in with five goals and seven assists in 25 outings. At the end of the season he returned to Hamburg and played regularly in the first half of the season.\\xa0Choupo-Moting signed with Mainz for the start of 2010/11\\xa0in what turned out to be a highly successful move for him. His performance has grabbed the attention of several German and Italian clubs. Choupo-Moting played international youth football for Germany but never progressed to the senior side, which left him open for an approach from Cameroon officials. He was duly called up for the CAF Africa Cup of Nations in January 2010, but the rangy\\xa0player was ultimately unable to travel due to administrative problems. Cameroon\\xa0did not give up on him though, and he made the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 squad and played his first game on the global stage. Since then, he has been a regular in the Indomitable\\xa0Lions squad. He played five matches in the Brazil 2014 qualifiers, scoring a goal in each of hs first two, as Cameroon secured a second-consecutive appearance at the World Cup. "}, {"Pierre WEBO": "After featuring in virtually every qualifier for\\xa0both the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups\u2122, the utterly dependable Pierre Webo had to wait until Cameroon's two play-off matches against Tunisia before he saw action in the Brazil 2014 preliminaries. The striker's first outing for his country came in 2003 and he has since taken part in two CAF Africa Cup of Nations competitions. His finest achievement to date with the Indomitable Lions was the hat-trick he scored against C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in a qualifier for Germany 2006 A whole-hearted competitor, Webo started his professional career at Gambia\u2019s Real Banju before decamping to Uruguay, where he made his name with Nacional of Montevideo. Scoring 15 times in 21 matches, he was the leading marksman in the league in 2002, an achievement that awakened the interest of a number of sides across the Atlantic. He then spent nearly nine seasons in Spain, first with second division outfit Leganes, then Osasuna and finally Real Mallorca. At the beginning of the 2011/12 season he joined Turkish club Istanbul BB before signing for Turkish giants Fenerbahce in January 2013. Like he had done for Istanbul BB, he scored on his debut for the Yellow Canaries. "}, {"Fabrice OLINGA": "Having just turned 18, Fabrice Olinga's inclusion in Cameroon's\\xa0FIFA World Cup\u2122 squad came as a surprise. Not only because of his tender age, but also because he played just 21 minutes in the Indomitable Lions' qualifying campaign.\\r\\nHowever, Olinga is no newcomer to making a name for himself. He became the youngest-ever goalscorer in the Spanish top flight when he scored the only goal of Malaga's opening game of the 2012/13 season. Olinga, who was 16 years and 98 days at the time, came on in the 60th minute for his first professional game and scored the goal from close range six minutes from the end to give Malaga the victory against Celta Vigo. The forward started playing with the Samuel Eto'o Foundation in Cameroon before moving to Spain as a 13-year-old. He joined the youth ranks of Mallorca before moving to Malaga. He has since moved to Belgian club Zulte Waregem on loan. His rise with Cameroon has been similarly meteoric, as he scored on his debut in an CAF Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Equatorial Guinea. Although Olinga can not become the youngest-ever scorer at the World Cup\\xa0\u2013 that record belongs to Brazilian legend Pele who scored against Wales at the finals in Sweden, aged 17 years and 239 days \u2013 he is hoping to feature on the world's greatest footballing stage.

A naturally gifted front man, Gutierrez formed a deadly strike partnership with Radamel Falcao in the qualifiers for Brazil 2014 and was Colombia\u2019s second-highest scorer with six goals in 11 games, an impressive return for a player who prefers to occupy a withdrawn role and help out with creative duties. Born and brought up in the tough Barranquilla neighbourhood of La Chinita, Gutierrez has suffered in the past from disciplinary problems owing to his fiery character, though his unique qualities also make him a matchwinner, the kind of player who can decide games single-handedly. A River Plate fan ever since his father gave him the club\u2019s shirt, the Colombian is now a \\xa0idol, having spent most of his career on the road, starting out with hometown side Junior before trying his luck with Trabzonspor, Cruz Azul of Mexico and a clutch of other teams. Under Jose Pekerman he has become an indispensable member of the  side. Part of the Colombia set-up since 2009, he will head to Brazil as one of the stars of a side determined to improve on the country\u2019s best ever world finals performance, which came when they reached the last 16 at Italy 1990. "}, {"Victor IBARBO": "Victor Ibarbo\u2019s long, rangy stride recalls that of Faustino Asprilla, a living legend of Colombian football, though it is his ability to side-step opponents, like his idol Robinho, that is his strongest suit. Capable of putting two roulette turns together and taking out up to three rivals in one fell swoop, Ibarbo is as audacious a wide man as they come. As well as dancing his way past defenders, he can also shoot with either foot and is an able passer of the ball, while his imposing 6\u20192 frame allows him to absorb challenges without losing his balance or the ball. The 23-year-old winger made his debut with Atletico Nacional in 2008, setting sail three years later for Cagliari, where his mazy dribbling has made him a favourite with the fans. After representing Colombia at youth level he received his first call-up to the senior team in 2010, though he was unable to cement a place in the side. Despite not using him in the qualifiers for Brazil 2014, Jose Pekerman is an ardent admirer of the elusive Ibarbo and began adding him to his squads in late 2013, aware that his ability to glide past opponents could prove a formidable weapon for Colombia at the world finals. "}, {"Carlos BACCA": "His speed, ability to carve himself out scoring opportunities, and predatory instincts in front of goal make Carlos Bacca a player any coach would want in their team. And at the age of 27, the Sevilla centre-forward heads to Brazil 2014 in the form of his life. Bacca\u2019s career is atypical, given that he did not star in Colombia\u2019s top flight until the age of 23. Nevertheless, he has since made up for lost time, and when he was handed an opportunity by Junior de Barranquilla, he grabbed it. The striker\u2019s impressive performances in the Colombian league earned him a transfer to Europe with Club Brugge in 2012. Bacca proved a revelation in Belgium, finishing as the league\u2019s top scorer in his second season, with 25 goals in 35 games. He then took another step up by joining Sevilla last summer. After making his debut in a friendly against Bolivia in 2010, Bacca was not recalled to the Colombia squad until October 2012. Since then, however, he has been vying for his place in the team coached by Jose Pekerman. In the World Cup qualifiers, the 27-year-old featured in three games, although only once as a starter.  "}, {"Adrian RAMOS": "Tall and strong with impressive aerial ability, skill and a great eye for goal, the explosive scoring form of Adrian Ramos in the Bundesliga has made the Colombia striker one of the revelations of the season in Europe, even at the age of 28. Ramos came to prominence at America de Cali and first featured for his country at the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2003. There, he was part of a Colombia squad which also included current team-mates Fredy Guarin and Cristian Zapata. Six years later, he finally made the move to Europe, although his five-season spell at Hertha Berlin has not always been smooth, with two of those spent in Germany\u2019s second division. After making his full international debut in 2008 and playing six games in the qualifiers in the build-up to South Africa 2010, Ramos also featured at the Copa America in 2011. The striker then lost his place, even though he was part of coach Jose Pekerman\u2019s plans at the beginning of the qualifying campaign for Brazil 2014. His current form has seen him make a return to the international fold, however, and  now heads to the World Cup in the finest form of his career.\\xa0 "}, {"Jackson MARTINEZ": "In becoming a striker, Jackson Martinez has followed in the footsteps of his father, who was a goalscorer but never played the game professionally. Those that saw Martinez Sr in action say he was a prodigious header of the ball, a quality his son has inherited, making him a major threat at set pieces. Technically gifted despite being over six foot tall, Martinez is a tireless worker, forever closing down opponents and creating space for team-mates. Adept at passing and shooting first time, he has a penchant for making acrobatic attempts on goal. He made his professional debut for Independiente Medellin in 2004. After scoring 17 goals in 20 matches for them in 2009 he switched to Jaguares of Mexico, where he stayed for three years before signing for Porto. Given the brief of replacing his countryman Radamel Falcao, Martinez has risen to the challenge superbly. An international since 2009, he took part in the preliminaries for South Africa 2010 and the 2011 Copa America before making seven appearances in the Brazil 2014 qualifiers.

Coming of age in the Saprissa youth system, Campbell spent his first two professional years - from 2009 to 2011 - with\\xa0the club's\\xa0senior squad. In August of 2011, the much sought-after Campbell signed a five-year contract with English side Arsenal. Despite the contract, Arsenal and Campbell struggled to obtain a work permit, and so he has spent the past few seasons building his skills with Lorient, Betis and Olympiacos. Campbell has been impressing teams across Europe with his precision, quick feet and steady presence on the field, all qualities he is prized for on his home turf as well.\\xa0 Internationally, Campbell represented Costa Rica in the U-17 CONCACAF Championship in 2009 and again in the U-20 edition of the competition in 2011. His hard work and tenacity in the 2011 tournament saw him finish as top scorer. The youngster has burst onto coach Jorge Luis Pinto\u2019s radar during qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, featuring in 15 matches and scoring four goals en route to Costa Rica\u2019s impressive second place finish in the CONCACAF\\xa0 "}, {"Bryan RUIZ": "Bryan Ruiz has been building a reputation as a lethal marksman and playmaker since his start with Alajuelense at the tender age of 18. Starting in 2003 and before his amicable departure in 2006, Ruiz helped usher in various regional titles, including the CONCACAF Champions' Cup. In July of 2006, Ruiz moved to Gent and in a little over a year he earned the captain\u2019s armband and became top scorer for the team. His strong performance for the Belgians caught the eye of several Dutch teams and in July of 2009 Ruiz signed with FC Twente. In May 2010, his team won their first Eredivise title in club history and it is more than fair to say Ruiz was essential to Twente\u2019s success. He finished the season as the team\u2019s top scorer and by August 2011 was being closely watched by a plethora of English Premier League sides.\\xa0 Fulham successfully landed Ruiz in 2011, and the forward enjoyed a fine run of form until he broke his foot in April 2012. Ruiz had difficulty regaining his spot in the starting XI after the injury, but he finished the 2012/13 campaign with five goals, and he is currently enjoying a productive loan with Dutch heavyweights PSV.  While he has continually proven his worth at the club level, Ruiz has not been able to consistently reproduce his goal scoring touch for Costa Rica, despite earning more than 60 caps. That will only fuel Ruiz to impress at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, which could prove to be very troublesome for opposing defences. And with 17 appearances in South Africa 2010 and another 11 during the Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign, Ruiz\u2019s experience at the highest levels of international football gives him the added confidence needed to succeed this summer.

An impressive first season set the forward up for success with the Nordic club, and he did not disappoint. He was the top scorer in 2006 with 13 goals, six of them headers. He helped his team win promotion to the Norweigian Tippeligaen, where they finished fourth, in part thanks to Brenes\u2019 hard work. Because of his successes with Bodo, Brenes was loaned to fellow Norwegian club Kongsvinger. He is credited with helping that team also remain in Norway\u2019s top league. Shortly afterwards, however, Brenes longed for the Costa Rican warmth and terminated his contract in Norway to return home to live with his family. He returned in 2010 to Cartagines and quickly became their top scorer. In a slightly surprising move for a rising star, Brenes moved in 2012 to Azerbaijan to play for Khazar Lankaran on a two-year contract. After finding only rocky footing on the Central Asian pitch,\\xa0he once again returned home to play for Cartagines.

The striker got his start, like many of his team-mates, with Alajuelense and put away ten goals in three years for the Costa Rican club, winning the 2010 Invierno championship along the way. Urena took a different direction in 2011, though, signing for Russian Premier League side Kuban Krasnodar. His playing time has fluctuated while in Russia, but he still managed to make the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup side and scored three goals in two games in that competition.

Jelavic made six appearances during qualifying, but only two of those were in the starting line-up. His solitary goal on the road to the World Cup was the matchwinner in a 1-0 victory over FYR Macedonia, five minutes after entering the pitch as a substitute.

What is more, just a few weeks after arriving in Florence, he was given his senior international debut by then coach Igor Stimac and scored in a win over Lichtenstein. Stimac was replaced as coach by Niko Kovac in October, but if anything that has been yet another positive for the ambitious Rebic, who had previously played under Kovac in the U-21s. The new man at the helm instantly put his trust in the youngster, using him from the bench in both of Croatia\u2019s play-off games for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 against Iceland.

By the time Rooney had recovered, he was a Manchester United player following his August 2004 switch to Old Trafford for a \u00a327m fee. He rose to the occasion once more on his United debut, hitting a hat-trick against Fenerbahce in the UEFA Champions League. His talent was without question yet there were doubts over his temperament and they resurfaced to unhappy effect at the FIFA World Cup in Germany.  Rooney had rushed back from another metatarsal injury to take his place in England\u2019s squad but he was not at his best and another quarter-final against Portugal ended prematurely for him \u2013 albeit this time with a red card for stamping on Ricardo Carvalho. Four years on from Gelsenkirchen, Rooney had a forgettable tournament in South Africa, failing to score and criticising England fans who booed the team off against Algeria.  He captained England for the first time in a Doha friendly against Brazil and is now England\u2019s all-time scorer in competitive internationals. At Manchester United he has won five Premier League titles, the UEFA Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup.  For all his star quality, he still works tirelessly for his team and no defence will look forward to facing him in Brazil.

At Old Trafford he has won the Premier League trophy, the Football League Cup and was even part of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s squad which clinched the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan six years ago.  Welbeck was an U-16 international at the age of just 14, coming on as a substitute against Wales in the Victory Shield, and was also part of the England squad which reached the quarter-finals of the FIFA U-17 World Cup in Korea in 2007.  The pacy forward made his debut for the U-21s in February 2009, coming on as a substitute for Adam Johnson and a further two years later, he gained a senior call-up while on loan at Sunderland. He made his England debut in March 2011 in a 1\u20131 friendly draw against Ghana, the nationality of both of his parents.  Welbeck netted his first senior international goal on 2 June 2012, scoring the only goal in a 1\u20130 friendly victory over Belgium and was part of Roy Hodgson\u2019s squad for UEFA EURO 2012 in which scored with a backheel to give England a dramatic 3-2 victory over Sweden.  "}, {"Rickie LAMBERT": "After a career which saw him learn his trade in the lower leagues with clubs such as Macclesfield Town, Stockport County, Rochdale and Bristol Rovers, Rickie Lambert really sprang to attention when he joined Southampton.  The forward helped fire the Saints from the third tier into the Premier League in successive seasons and then continued to shine in the top-flight.  Lambert\u2019s first England call-up came in August 2013 when Three Lions manager Roy Hodgson selected him for the game with Scotland at Wembley on the same day that his wife gave birth to their third child, a daughter, Bella. He scored with his first touch of his international career, just two minutes and 43 seconds after coming on as a substitute securing a 3\u20132 win for England.  Lambert was handed a start by Roy Hodgson against Moldova on 6 September 2013 in a FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifier. He got his second international goal in this game. He also contributed the assist for two Danny Welbeck goals in the same game as England ran out 4-0 winners.

Naturally right-footed, this hugely gifted and strong-willed front-runner developed a remarkable proficiency with his left after breaking his right leg at four years of age. Not even a cast could stop the youngster playing football, so he simply learned to use his less-favoured foot. \\xa0 A product of the youth system at Sporting Gijon, for whom he shone in the La Liga between 2001 and 2003, Villa then spent two productive seasons at Real Zaragoza before signing on the dotted line for Valencia, where he would go on to become one of the most coveted goalgetters on Planet Football.  \\r\\n\\xa0 After making his  debut in February 2005, Villa has been a key element of the Spain success story that followed their disappointing early exit at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany\u2122.

Torres is a striker who combines skill, pace and power, especially when breaking into space. Still known as , despite having turned 30, the Chelsea man can take on and beat his man and can also create space for team-mates by pulling defenders out of position.\\r\\nHaving learned his trade at Atletico Madrid, where he remains an idol, Torres proved a revelation when he arrived in the English Premier League in 2007, excelling in a four-season stay at Liverpool. Though his form has wavered since his move to Chelsea, his ability and nose for goal have remained intact, allowing him to overcome dips in form by being top scorer at both EURO 2012 and the FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil 2013. "}, {"Pedro RODRIGUEZ": "Small in stature but a heavyweight in Barcelona's attack, Pedro is a skilful, two-footed forward with searing pace, a keen eye for goal and good long-range shooting ability.  After joining Barcelona as a 17-year-old, Pedro spent four years in the club's youth and reserve sides, before being introduced to the first team in 2008 by Pep Guardiola. An impressive 2009/10 pre-season then cemented his place in the senior side. And within just six months he had already made history, becoming the first player to score in six different competitions \u2013 La Liga, Copa del Rey, Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup 2009 \u2013 in a single season. Pedro followed that impressive feat with his first international call-up, earning a place in Spain's title-winning squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122. Since then he has been a regular for , with whom he also won the UEFA EURO in 2012.

Capable of playing in the hole or on the left side of midfield, he can also drop back when required and show what he can do as a playmaker. Untypically for a footballer, Mata likes to switch off from the pressures of the professional game by reading biographies and novels, and was studying two university degrees when football gave him the chance to pursue a new career. After starting out as a youngster at Oviedo, Mata then joined the youth set-up at Real Madrid before making the breakthrough at Valencia. It was not until he moved to Chelsea, however, that he really came into his own.  Denied a regular starting place by new Blues boss Jose Mourinho in the first half of last season, Mata, aware of the need to press his claim for a place at Brazil 2014, decided to accept an offer from Manchester United. Having represented Spain at every level from U-15 upwards, Mata made his full international debut in 2009 and formed part of the  squads that won the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 and UEFA EURO 2012. "}, {"Diego COSTA": "Blending raw power, nifty footwork, pace to burn and a feisty on-the-pitch persona, Diego Costa offers far more than your average fox in the box.  Brazil-born, Costa grew up playing street football in his hometown of Lagarto, before going on to sign professional terms with Portuguese outfit Braga at the age of 16. His talent soon caught the eye of Atletico Madrid, who snapped up the marksman in 2007 and promptly farmed him out on loan.  It was not until 2012, following stints at Celta, Albacete, Valladolid and Rayo Vallecano, that Costa would get the chance to make his mark in the  first team. After starting the season playing understudy to Radamel Falcao and Adrian, he quickly won over coach Diego Simeone with a series of impressive performances, particularly in the Spanish Cup, in which he finished top scorer as Atletico lifted the 2012-13 edition of the trophy.  Beyond his lethal finishing \u2013 he has racked up more than 50 goals over the last year \u2013 Costa is also renowned for his versatility, which allows him to run the channels and cut into the box to devastating effect. Costa earned his first international call-up for Brazil in March 2013, featuring in two friendlies. However, after being granted Spanish citizenship in July that year, he decided to switch allegiances and represent , who were lured by his directness and goalscoring ability.

Nicknamed , Cabella has just enjoyed a stunning season with Montpellier, scoring 14 goals for the club \u2013 as many as he had managed in the previous four years of his professional career \u2013 and serving up five assists. A skilled performer in one-on-one situations, Cabella also possesses a fearsome shot and can light up any match with his talent on the ball. Another area in which he has developed beyond all recognition this year is his vision and reading of the game. Born in Ajaccio to a Corsican mother and an Italian father, Cabella started playing football at a very early age, joining Gazelec Ajaccio\u2019s youth ranks before winning a place at Montpellier\u2019s academy in 2004. Only a couple of months after turning professional, however, he suffered torn ligaments in his right knee and was out of action for some time. His French Ligue 1 debut eventually came in December 2010, while his first league goals, a brace, came in January 2012. He helped his club lift the French title five months later and has been a first choice in the side ever since.\\xa0 "}, {"Olivier GIROUD": "Powerful, athletic and strong in the air, Olivier Giroud is also supremely comfortable in front of goal, where his finishing, one-touch play and ability to improvise make him a constant menace. The striker's journey to the top was a gradual one, however, and he began by spending five years in France's lower leagues \u2013 including one on loan in the third tier \u2013 before getting his first tilt at the elite with Montpellier in 2010/11. After that, everything began to accelerate for Giroud, and he won his maiden France cap the following season as he topped the scoring charts while helping his club win the Ligue 1 title.\\r\\nHe moved to Arsenal fresh from that landmark campaign and was immediately faced with the challenge of replacing departed forward Robin van Persie. Giroud may be less prolific than the Dutch phenomenon, yet he has proved a valuable presence up front for the Gunners, with his style and tireless effort also winning over supporters, who sing his name to the tune of The Beatles' classic 'Hey Jude'. Meanwhile, on the international stage, after first being used as an understudy to Karim Benzema, Giroud has increasingly come to be seen as an alternative option by Didier Deschamps. Indeed, it was the Arsenal man who struck the equaliser in a 1-1 draw away against Spain in a 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifier on 16 October 2012. "}, {"Karim BENZEMA": "The word 'phenomenon' was aired more than a few times when Karim Benzema first burst onto the scene, the term both highlighting the striker's emerging talent and echoing the nickname of his idol, Ronaldo. Benzema enjoyed a staggering rise to prominence during the early part of his career, progressing from youth to European football and the France set-up at a rate of knots. Indeed, he was still just 21 when a Real Madrid side looking to build a second generation of  brought him to Spain along with Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. First taught the ropes at Lyon, he made his Ligue 1 debut in January 2005. His UEFA Champions League bow came the following season, and he notched his first goal in the competition against Rosenborg, having yet to open his account in the French championship. Playing alongside proven forwards Sylvain Wiltord, Sidney Govou, Fred and Milan Baros, Benzema learned quickly and reached new heights in 2007/08, finishing top scorer and receiving France's player of the year award. Europe's leading outfits all took note, and he realised a childhood dream by joining Madrid in July 2009, leaving Lyon with a quartet of league titles to his name. His international career has followed a similar trajectory, Benzema helping France win the 2004 UEFA European U-17 Championship and prospering at U-18, U-19 and U-21 level before earning his first senior call-up in autumn 2006. Injury ruled him out on that occasion, but he eventually made his debut aged 19 in March 2007, coming on at half-time and scoring the winner in a friendly against Austria. Trailing behind Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka in the pecking order, he was left out of Raymond Domenech's squad for South Africa 2010, but he won the faith of Laurent Blanc and led the line at UEFA EURO 2012. Benzema also began the Didier Deschamps era as first choice, only for a long goal drought to cost him his place and earn Olivier Giroud promotion. The Madrid man responded with renewed form in 2013/14, forcing his way back into the side in time for Brazil 2014.

Brought through the Spanish side's youth ranks, the left-footed tyro swiftly tied down a regular place after breaking into the first team during their promotion-winning 2009/10 campaign. With Sociedad putting faith in home-grown young talents, Griezmann continued his progress in the elite and enjoyed a landmark year in 2013, with his 18 goals more than any other French player in Europe's five most prestigious championships. \\r\\nConsidered a rising star back in his homeland, Griezmann has already racked up a number of highlights with his country.

Capable of operating as a lone striker or on the right, Remy eventually made his Ligue 1 debut as a substitute for Wiltord in October 2006, but it was during a six-month loan spell at Lens that he truly began expressing himself. Just two months into his stay, in fact, Remy was called up by then France coach Raymond Domenech, who saw the youngster as a potential successor to Thierry Henry.\\r\\nA transfer to Nice in 2008 proved another turning point, and Remy soon made a name for himself as one of the most gifted marksmen in Ligue 1, with a maiden France cap finally coming in June 2009. It was his last before Domenech named his 23-man squad for South Africa 2010, and although he was left off the list, Remy earned a switch to Marseille that same summer.

However, he struggled to break into the starting XI after joining the club from Borussia Monchengladbach\u2019s second side and was loaned out to Panionios and Atromitos in 2011 and 2012, grabbing 24 goals across the two spells. Despite making his international debut in 2009, he had to wait for a regular starting place, missing out on the 2010 World Cup before playing just 19 minutes at UEFA EURO 2012. Fernando Santos then decided to make Mitroglou the focal point of the Greek attack after his impressive performances with Olympiacos, which helped them to a Greek Super League title in 2012/13. His vital goals helped see his country qualify for Brazil, but the Fulham man retains admirable modesty. \u201cWe are all heroes,\u201d he told  in a recent interview. \u201cThe entire team, the entire country, all Greeks!

A youth player at PAOK Thessaloniki, he was loaned out to Larissa in 1999 and spent two more years at second division AV Kavala, ending one of those seasons as the league\u2019s top scorer. Recalled by PAOK, Salpingidis would then score the small matter of 50 goals in 103 games, establishing himself as the club\u2019s first-choice striker, captain and the leading goalscorer in the land, also claiming a place in the Greece side. He joined Panathinaikos in 2006 and repaid part of his substantial transfer fee by scoring a hat-trick on his league debut against Aigaleo. A member of the Greece side that contested the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament Athens 2004, Salpingidis has been a permanent fixture in the full national team since 2005. The forward appeared at the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 and scored in his country\u2019s historic first win on the global stage, their 2-1 victory over Nigeria.

He also finished the 2004/05 season as the leading scorer in the Greek Super League and topped the German Bundesliga chart with Bochum two years later. His somewhat circuitous club career began in the late 1990s at second division side AEL 1964. Gekas then joined league rivals Kallithea and his goalscoring exploits saw the side promoted to the top flight which brought about a move to Panathinaikos in 2005. Having finished that season as the country\u2019s leading scorer, it was no surprise when he was drafted into the Greece squad for the FIFA Confederations Cup Germany 2005. He moved to Bochum on loan in 2007, where he was top scorer in the German top flight, before signing permanently with Bayer Leverkusen. Since then, he has appeared for German sides Hertha Berlin and Eintracht Frankfurt, English club Portsmouth, Spanish side Levante and Turkish teams Samsunspor and Akhisar Belediyespor before settling at current side Konyaspor last year. Gekas grabbed two goals in Greece\u2019s successful qualification campaign for Brazil.

The faith\\xa0the Greek giants showed in the attacking midfielder was repaid as he stayed with the club for close to a decade, winning three consecutive Greek Super League titles and a Greek Cup before moving to\\xa0Genoa at the start of the 2013/14 season.  \u2018Fetfa\u2019, as he is known affectionately by Greek fans, has a distinct style brought on by his diminutive figure, with his close control and trickery making him an exciting talent.

Bengtson made his professional breakthrough for La Ceiba side Vida in August 2007, shortly after turning 20. A month and a half later he netted the first of the 32 goals he would go on to rack up during three seasons at the club, after which he departed with the club's blessing for Motagua. He continued his love affair with the back of the net in his new surroundings, being crowned top scorer in the division\\xa0in his first campaign and in the process becoming the first Honduran to win the accolade three seasons on the bounce. Given this irresistible goalscoring form, international recognition soon followed and Bengtson made his debut in a friendly against Venezuela in April 2010. His first outing to a major tournament came at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, where he scored three times as Honduras sprang a surprise by reaching the quarter-finals. Now with MLS outfit New England Revolution, the sharpshooter played a key role again in qualifying for Brazil 2014, finishing as his country's top marksman with nine goals to inspire Honduras to claim automatic qualification for the main event this summer.

Born the month after that tournament, some 20 years later Carlo took his first steps in professional football at Platense. His never-say-die attitude when chasing down every lost cause\\xa0up front and his thunderous left-footed strikes from long range soon made him a firm fan favourite. He went on to earn his first full Honduras call-up in 2007, shortly prior to seeking out pastures new with a move to Poland.  Costly was a vital cog in the squad that made it to South Africa 2010, ending Honduras\\'s 28-year hiatus from the world stage, only to miss the finals with an untimely injury. \"I was really upset.

That lack of experience did not hold him back when he made his debut for Honduras\u2019 Real Sociedad in 2012, the front man going on to score 12 goals in that year\u2019s Torneo Clausura and ending it as the leading marksman.\\xa0 Nicknamed , Martinez is a versatile striker with a knack for being in the right place at the right time at set pieces and who uses his muscular frame and pace to get the better of opposing defenders. His first cap came in 2013 in a friendly against Israel. He was then called up for his country\u2019s 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifiers that June but failed to see any action, though he opened his international goalscoring account a month later in a CONCACAF Gold Cup match against Haiti.

"}, {"Khosro HEYDARI": "A talented right-back, Khosro Heydari's career is marked out by two spells with Esteghlal, sandwiched by a short stint with Sepahan in 2010/11. It is with the two giants of Tehran that Heydari has proven something of a trophy-collector, with three league titles (one with Sepahan) and a Hazfi Cup garnered down the years.  Heydari started with Aboomoslem in 2002 but he made his name in Pas, with whom he became a central figure as the side finished as runners-up in 2005/06 Iranian league. His outstanding displays saw him scooped up by Esteghlal in 2008, where he tasted his maiden league success in his debut season with the Blues.  Beyond his defensive abilities, Heydari is also a danger when rampaging down the flanks and was a member of the Iran U-23 squad that won bronze in the 2006 Asian Games. Since making his international debut against Palestine in the 2007 West Asian Football Federation Championship, he has been a regular player with Team Melli. Known for his inch-perfect crosses, he emerged one of the most consistent performers throughout Iran's qualifying campaign for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, during which his side sealed progression in style.  "}, {"Masoud SHOJAEI": "With Ali Karimi\u2019s retirement from international football last year, the task of bossing Iran\u2019s midfield fell on the shoulders of 29-year-old Masoud Soleimani Shojaei. Iranian fans know all too well that the Las Palmas midfielder\u2019s form is the key if  are to spring a surprise or two at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122. Shaojaei emerged as a promising star during his early days with Saipa. As a teenager, he dazzled viewers with his stunning pace and sophistication on the ball, with to likening him to Karimi. His talents did not go unnoticed by then-coach Branko Ivankovic, who called him into the national team in 2004. He showed a glimpse of his genius in his international debut against Laos in a qualifier for Germany 2006, providing a superb assist as Iran won 7-0.  Despite missing the final qualifying round, Shaojaei was a surprise inclusion in Ivankovic\u2019s World Cup squad. He had a fiery baptism on the world stage in Iran\u2019s last match against Angola, coming on for the final 13 minutes as his side drew 1-1 for their only point.  After spending the next two years with Al Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, he left for Spain to join compatriot Javad Nekonam with Osasuna, accumulating over a century of appearances there. Meanwhile, he established his place with the national team through a series of solid displays. He figured prominently throughout Iran\u2019s qualifying for South Africa 2010 although his side narrowly missed out on the finals itself. He may have missed Iran\u2019s early campaign on the road to Brazil 2014 due to injury, but pulled his weight in the last four games as his side sealed progression as group winners.  Like Karimi, Shojaei is capable of marauding through rivals\u2019 defences at will courtesy of his sublime dribbling and lightning speed. "}, {"Alireza JAHAN BAKHSH": "At 20-years-old, Alireza Jahan Bakhsh comes to Brazil as the youngest player in Carlos Queiroz's Iran squad. Despite his tender age, though, the talented midfielder has been heralded as one of the country's most promising stars. Jahan Bakhsh exploded on the Asian scene in the 2012 AFC U-19 Championship, skippering Iran through a tough group featuring Japan, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates to reach the last eight. In the process, he opened the scoring in a 1-1 draw against UAE, a result which helped them finish ahead of their three rivals with an undefeated record. It was his eye-catching displays during the Asian youth competition that convinced a watching scout from NEC Nijmegen to snap him up for the Dutch side last year.  The winger continued his good form with NEC in the Dutch Eredivisie and his brilliant performances didn't go unnoticed by Queiroz, who called him up to the national team soon after. Following his debut for Iran \u2013 as a substitute in a 2015 AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Thailand last October \u2013 he went on to score his first international goal when he sealed a 3-0 return-leg victory against the same opponents with a stoppage-time strike a month later.  "}, {"Karim ANSARI FARD": "Hailed as the successor to international goal-king Ali Daei, Karim Ansari has emerged as one of the hottest prospects in Iran over recent years. The 24-year-old is, in fact, a pupil by the Iranian legend, who spotted and brought him to Saipa during his tenure in charge of the club.  Ansari graduated from the club's youth academy into the first team in 2007. The slender forward quickly established himself as Saipa's new talisman, achieving a double-digit scoring-tally for the first time in 2010. It took him just another two years to become the league's top-marksman when he edged a series of imported and home-grown stars to top the scoring-chart with 21 goals.  When former Iran manager Afshin Ghotbi called him up to the national team in 2009, the then-teenager came off the bench to score the only goal against Iceland in a friendly on his international debut. Within two years Ansari had forced his way into the starting line-up of Iran. He has racked up 9 goals in 39 international appearances thus far, including scoring three times during Iran's successful qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122.  "}, {"Reza GHOOCHANNEJAD": "If his eye-catching displays during qualification are anything to go by, Reza Ghoochannejhad looks set to shoulder Iran's goal-scoring intentions as his side aim to reach the second round of the FIFA World Cup\u2122 for the first time. The striker, in a sense, became Iran\u2019s new rescuer during their qualifying campaign. Initially a relative unknown plying his trade in Belgium, he revived Iran's fortunes with his first goal in qualifying during a 1-0 victory in Qatar, before hitting the target again a week later in the 4-0 home defeat of Lebanon. The 26-year-old maintained his form into their final game against Korea Republic, scoring the only goal in Ulsan as they booked their passage to Brazil 2014 as group winners. Born in Iran but brought up in the Netherlands, , as he is now affectionately known to fans, was a fresh face on the Asian scene when he was called up by coach Carlos Queiroz in October 2012. Impressed by his performance for Sint-Truiden in a Belgian Jupiler Pro League game against Lierse, the former Portugal and Real Madrid boss wasted no time in calling him up.  Queiroz gave him his international debut in a crucial home qualifier against Korea Republic, starting the forward in what ended as a 1-0 Iran win. Even after a disappointing home defeat to Uzbekistan, a result which put Iran's campaign in jeopardy, Queiroz maintained his faith in Ghoochannejhad. He was eventually proven right, with scoring three goals in as many games across a fortnight, including two match-winners, as Iran progressed somewhat against the odds. The decisive goal against the Koreans was the embodiment of 's predatory talents. With Iran largely on the back foot and approaching the final half-hour, the Mashhad-born striker stole the ball from Kim Younggwon, darting to the edge of the penalty area, before unleashing a trademark left-footed strike past the goalkeeper. "}, {"Ashkan DEJAGAH": "Having made his name in Germany, and now playing his football with Fulham in England, Ashkan Dejagah stands as one of the most recognisable members of Carlos Queiroz\u2019 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 squad.  Iranian fans were indebted to the Portuguese manager for his efforts in securing the services of the then VfL Wolfsburg midfielder during qualifying for Brazil 2014 three years ago. Born in Tehran and raised in Berlin, Dejegah started his career with Hertha BSC. He exploded on to the scene with the German U-19 team in 2004 as he scored seven goals from 15 matches. The prodigy naturally graduated into the German U-21 side, with whom he won the UEFA U-21 Championship in 2009.  Having played for two German youth teams, Dejagah was presented with the options of representing either his adopted country or his motherland. Both former Iran coach Afshin Ghotbi and Queiroz came calling, with his debut for Iran finally coming on 29 February 2012. He could not have made a better start with , scoring a brace as Iran drew 2-2 with Qatar in a World Cup qualifier. Later that year he secured a move to the English Premier League with Fulham, initially being limited to showing flashes of the form he had shown in Germany. However, as he has settled into the English game, despite an injury-disrupted season, he became a key figure in Fulham's fight against relegation with his pace and direct attacking purpose. Although those spells on the sidelines saw him miss several crucial World Cup qualifying matches, Dejagah played a key role during Iran successfully reaching the 2015 AFC Asian Cup. He opened the scoring on the road to a 3-0 victory in Thailand, before being on target in a 4-1 triumph against Lebanon to book progression with a game to spare.  "}, {"Mario BALOTELLI": "Mario Balotelli leaves no one indifferent with his combination of sublime talent and his knack for attracting the wrong kind of headlines. An explosive striker, he possesses a technique so natural that he is often accused of nonchalance. What is inarguable is that Balotelli can change the course of a match with a single touch of the ball, and he is equally effective from set-pieces. Born to Ghanaian parents Thomas and Rose in Palermo on 12 August 1990, Balotelli suffered severe intestinal problems as a child and underwent a series of operations. Unable to pay for his treatment, his parents, who had moved to Lombardy, agreed to let their three-year-old son be put in a foster home. Raised by Francesco and Silvia Balotelli, he nevertheless had to wait until he turned 18 before acquiring Italian citizenship in August 2008. At the age of 17, Balotelli made his debut in Serie A for Inter Milan in December 2007. He played for three seasons at the San Siro, winning three league titles, the UEFA Champions League, a Coppa Italia and an Italian Super Cup. Along the way, he scored 28 goals in 86 games, clashing with coach Jose Mourinho and provoking his fair share of controversy. The Balotelli legend was well and truly under way. Tempted by the prospect of playing in the Premier League, the forward signed for Manchester City at the start of the 2010/11 season. The unwanted headlines followed him to England, however, and his relations with manager Roberto Mancini veered from one extreme to the other until he packed his bags for AC Milan in January 2013.  In contrast, Balotelli\u2019s experiences with the national team have been more consistently positive. Italy coach Cesare Prandelli called him up for the first time two days short of his 20th birthday for the 1-0 defeat to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire on 10 August 2010. He went on to enjoy an excellent UEFA EURO 2012, in particular notching a semi-final double against Germany, a match during which he set himself up as the spearhead of the Italian attack.\\xa0 "}, {"Antonio CASSANO": "Bari native Antonio Cassano is a player capable of changing the outcome of a game in the blink of an eye, but also a forthright personality with a history of heated interactions with coaches and sometimes even team-mates. At the peak of his powers, though, Cassano possesses a ball control that sets him apart from his peers, combined with the ability to dribble in tight spaces and distribute laser-guided through balls. He is most effective in his preferred  role, as a second striker behind the centre-forward.\\r\\nNicknamed , Cassano has turned out for an impressive list of big clubs, including Roma, Real Madrid, AC Milan and Inter Milan, winning league honours in both Italy and Spain. On the international stage, he represented his country in every age group before making his step up to the senior squad, for whom he has made over 30 appearances, collecting a runners-up medal at UEFA EURO 2012. Despite those achievements, the sense remains that he has not enjoyed a career to match his talents, having made as many headlines for run-ins with the likes of Fabio Capello, Marcello Lippi, Luigi Del Neri and Francesco Totti as he has for his exploits on the pitch.\\r\\nCassano has nonetheless changed since joining Parma at the start of the 2013/14 season, leaving the controversy behind him and rediscovering his best form. He asserts that fatherhood has transformed him and his exemplary approach has endeared him to club officials and colleagues alike, while also earning him one last adventure with  at the age of 31. "}, {"Alessio CERCI": "Cesare Prandelli, who has spent considerable time on the lookout for wide players, must take a lot of credit for unearthing Torino winger Alessio Cerci. Boasting fine technique and an eagerness to surge forward down the flanks, the natural left-footer can operate on the left or the right but prefers the latter as it offers better shooting opportunities. After spending his youth in Roma's academy, he made his first-team debut for the capital club aged 16 on 16 May 2004, catching the eye of then coach Fabio Capello.\\xa0That was the start of a rapid rise, but Cerci's progress was soon halted by a series of injuries, the Velletri native suffering a ruptured meniscus in his knee and cruciate ligament inflammation. Following three seasons out on loan, he joined Fiorentina in 2010, only to leave two years later after falling out with the club's fans.  \\r\\nCerci represented Italy at every age group during his adolescence and finally made the step up to the senior side on 17 March 2013 against Brazil (2-2), coming off the bench to replace Andrea Pirlo.

The Napoli-born forward also has versatility on his side, being able to play across the attack, while also boasting a knack for dribbling free in tight areas and unleashing vicious snap shots with both feet.\\r\\nImmobile's route to the top has been anything but traditional, however. Brought through the ranks at Sorrento and later Juventus, he featured just three times for  as he made his professional debut with the Turin giants in 2008. From there, the centre-forward was loaned out to Siena, Grosseto and finally Pescara, where he announced his talent in 2011/12 with 28 strikes in 38 outings that contributed heavily to his side's promotion to Serie A. \\r\\nImmobile was on the move again the following season, enduring a tough year at Genoa before signing for Torino last summer. It proved an excellent decision, and his partnership with Cerci not only set sparks flying early on, but it improved as the season continued. They finished the campaign as Italy's most prolific strike duo, with Immobile hitting 22 of their 33 goals overall to be crowned top scorer, and also weighing in with 13 assists. \\xa0 "}, {"Lorenzo INSIGNE": "Far from being disadvantaged by his short stature, Lorenzo Insigne is an explosive footballer who\\xa0takes opponents on at every opportunity,\\xa0using his low centre of gravity to throw them off balance. A product of the Napoli youth programme, Insigne is an attacking midfielder who operates with the same deadly efficiency whether tucked in behind the centre forward or stationed on the wing. Skilful in front of goal, he is also decisive in the final pass. Insigne cut his teeth in Napoli\u2019s youth teams. Then, in January 2010, after having made his debut in Serie A, he finished the season on loan at Cavese. It was not long before coach Zdenek Zeman noticed the young forward's flair and he obtained him a season-long loan deal with Foggia, where he scored 19 goals. The following season he went on loan to Serie B side Pescara where he helped them to win the title, racking up 18 goals and 8 assists in the process. Unsurprisingly, he was back in Naples for the start of the 2012/13 season and made his debut for the  on 11 September 2012 against Malta, coming on for Alessandro Diamanti. In August 2013, he scored his first international goal in a friendly against Argentina. "}, {"Keisuke HONDA": "Attacking midfielder Keisuke Honda has been a commanding figure in the Japanese national team in recent years, and adds a physical presence and cutting edge to the Samurai Blue attack. Honda has displayed a knack for scoring vital goals on the big stage. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122, he bagged the only goal in Japan\u2019s opener against Cameroon, and then drilled in a majestic long-range free-kick in the victory over Denmark. Honda\u2019s efforts went a long way to putting Japan into the Round of 16, and he has remained an integral part of the national team since Alberto Zaccheroni became coach in 2010.  Honda\u2019s great-uncle competed at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, and his brother also played football. Despite this sporting pedigree, Honda\u2019s football career had an inauspicious start. Honda played for the youth team at Gamba Osaka, who boasts a widely admired youth system, but he failed to earn selection returning to high school. After completing his studies, Honda was signed by Nagoya Grampus but already had ambitions of playing overseas. He fulfilled this dream when transferred to Dutch club VVV-Venlo in 2008, the same year he made his national team debut.  The player\u2019s appetite for goals caught the attention of CSKA Moscow, and he signed for the Russian powerhouse in 2010. In the UEFA Champions League that year, Honda made headlines when he scored with a 30m, left-foot free-kick against Sevilla, helping CSKA become only the second Russian team to reach the quarter-finals.  Before the 2010 World Cup, creative midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura had been the linchpin of Japan\u2019s attack. But concerned by Japan\u2019s misfiring front line, coach Takeshi Okada boldly decided to instead build his attack around Honda deploying him as a deep-lying centre forward. Honda repaid the faith and his strength, ability to retain possession and seemingly endless energy culminated in being named man of the match in the games against Cameroon, Denmark and the shoot-out defeat against Paraguay.  Since then, Honda has remained an automatic selection for the Samurai Blue. He helped power Japan to the 2011 AFC Asian Cup crown, and was hugely influential in several qualifying games on the road to Brazil, as well as the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.  In January 2014, Honda achieved a childhood dream in signing for AC Milan. Often outspoken, he has even publicly declared that Japan are aiming to win the 2014 World Cup.

Since making his international debut in 2011, Kiyotake has cemented a place in the national squad and was heavily involved in his nation\u2019s qualifiers for the 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122.  Kiyotake\u2019s superb performance in Japan\u2019s upset of Spain in their opening game at the 2012 London Olympics was a clear indication of his undoubted potential. The 24-year-old was an essential component of Japan\u2019s run to the semi-finals, where they were defeated by Korea Republic. A tireless runner, Kiyotake imbues Japan\u2019s attack with a fearsome long-range shot and inch-perfect passes that can unlock any defence. These skills have helped Kiyotake quickly establish himself in the German top tier.  After coming through the youth academy at his hometown team of Oita Trinita in south-western Japan, Kiyotake\u2019s appetite for goals earned him a call-up to Oita\u2019s top side. In 2010, he transferred to Cerezo Osaka and filled the void left when attacking midfielder Shinji Kagawa was signed by Borussia Dortmund. In 2012, Kiyotake followed in his footsteps with his own move to Germany. \\r\\nAlong with Kagawa and Takashi Inui, Kiyotake is a young midfielder who has illuminated Japan\u2019s offence in recent years.

This season Okazaki added another record to his impressive resume by surpassing Shinji Kagawa\u2019s benchmark for most goals by a Japanese player in a Bundesliga season while in the colours of Mainz. This accomplishment evidence that the hard work Okazaki has put in since moving to Germany in 2011 is finally starting to bear fruit. \u201cLooking back, I hadn\u2019t achieved much in three years in Germany,\u201d Okazaki reflected after setting the new record.  A clinical finisher capable of playing alone up front or with a strike partner, Okazaki has also been used as a winger for the Samurai Blue. Okazaki\u2019s quick acceleration, high work-rate and tenacity have even prompted some commentators to describe the 28-year-old as a \u201cJapanese Gerd Muller\u201d. Not afraid to throw himself about or make diving headers, the forward clearly relishes the physical side of the game.  Okazaki began his career in 2005 with Shimizu S-Pulse, signed for Bundesliga outfit VfB Stuttgart in the winter of 2011, before moving to Mainz in 2013.  Okazaki\u2019s ability to regularly find the target has made him a fixture in the national team. He made his debut for Japan in 2008, and endeared himself to Japanese fans the following year when he scored 15 goals in 16 appearances. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122, he tucked away a goal in Japan\u2019s 3-1 victory over Denmark in the group stage. Coach Alberto Zaccheroni has been a loyal advocate of Okazaki since taking over the national team, and Japan will be counting on him to maintain his knack for scoring in Brazil.

He established himself as a key player at Cerezo between 2008 and 2010, and was instrumental in the team\u2019s promotion to the J.League\u2019s top flight.  Despite acquitting himself well in the top tier, Kagawa was omitted from Japan\u2019s 2010 World Cup squad, but travelled to South Africa with the team as a \u2018supporting member\u2019. His reputation as one of Japan\u2019s most promising players was reinforced after he joined German powerhouse Borussia Dortmund in 2010. Although relatively unheralded in Germany at the time \u2013 Kagawa had been playing in J2 until the previous year \u2013 he was a perfect fit for Dortmund\u2019s attacking football under coach Jurgen Klopp. His appetite for goals and ability to create scoring chances for team-mates helped power Dortmund to the 2010/11 Bundesliga title.  Kagawa was poised to continue his meteoric rise in 2011, but a serious foot injury sustained in the semi-final of the AFC Asian Cup in Qatar wrecked the second half of his season, and he was not on the pitch when Dortmund sealed the title. However, the player was a vital cog the following season as Dortmund won a second consecutive crown. Kagawa\u2019s bourgeoning performances helped pave the way for Shinji Okazaki and an ever-growing number of Samurai Blue players who now ply their trade in Germany and other European leagues.  Kagawa\u2019s silky skills and deft passing can unlock any defence, and he is comfortable shooting with either foot. He also possesses clinical finishing, plus darting runs and movement off the ball \u2013 the latter enabling him to create space even in congested areas.  Since 2011, Kagawa has been entrusted with the No10 jersey for the national side, where he has formed a lethal attacking partnership with Keisuke Honda. Kagawa\u2019s star shone even brighter in the summer of 2012 when he transferred to Manchester United. His highlights at Old Trafford include becoming the first Asian to score a hat-trick in the Premier League.  The 25-year-old now tends to play on the left side for club and country but during his time at Dortmund he was mostly utilised just behind the front line, where he can display his vision and creativity.  Kagawa grew up admiring Kazuyoshi \u2018King Kazu\u2019 Miura, a forward who played professional football in Brazil before returning to Japan and becoming one of the stars of the J.League\u2019s early days.  "}, {"Yoichiro KAKITANI": "Although he might lack the international profile of Keisuke Honda and Shinji Kagawa, Cerezo Osaka forward Yoichiro Kakitani is arguably the most popular player in the J.League. His nose for goals and ability to also slot in as a \u201cshadow striker\u201d earned Kakitani selection to the national team at various age grades, and he could be vital to the Samurai Blue\u2019s ambitions of reaching the quarter-finals at a FIFA World Cup\u2122 for the first time.  Kakitani joined the respected Cerezo youth programme when he was a child, and at age 16 became the youngest player to sign a professional contract with the club\u2019s senior team. His goal-scoring feats at the FIFA U-17 World Cup 2007 turned many heads, but he had to wait until 2013 to make his international debut for the senior team.  The 24-year-old was widely considered a football prodigy during his early days, but Cerezo loaned him to Tokushima Vortis for several seasons after becoming frustrated by several indiscretions, including repeatedly arriving late to training. After improving his professionalism at the second-tier club, Kakitani returned to Cerezo and has developed into a regular starting player. This season, he has formed an eye-catching partnership with recent arrival Diego Forlan, Uruguay's top striker at South Africa 2010 and adidas Golden Ball recipient, who was barely edged out by Thomas Muller as the competition's Golden Boot winner. "}, {"Yoshito OKUBO": "After winning the J.League golden boot in 2013, striker Yoshito Okubo will be brimming with confidence as he appears at his second FIFA World Cup\u2122. Even so, the inclusion of the seasoned Kawasaki Frontale forward for Brazil 2014 was something of a surprise, as his last game for the Samurai Blue came more than two years ago.  Okubo\u2019s playing resume includes spells both in Japan and abroad. After graduating from high school, he joined Cerezo Osaka, a noted football academy that has produced top-class players such as Shinji Kagawa and Yoichiro Kakitani. A stint with Mallorca in the Spanish league was followed by a more productive return to Vissel Kobe. In 2009, he was signed by VfL Wolfsburg, which also had current Japan captain Makoto Hasebe on its books. Despite limited opportunities, Okubo helped Wolfsburg win the Bundesliga title before returning to Japan to link up again with Vissel prior to South Africa 2010. A string of sparkling performances proved impossible for Japan coach Takeshi Okada to ignore. In South Africa, Okubo was used on the wing, but also earned plaudits for contributing heavily in defence.  Although he has mostly been on the fringes at national team level since then, the surging runs and high work rate that powered his prolific 2013 season will ensure Okubo can hold his own on the world stage in Brazil.  "}, {"Yuya OSAKO": "A robust yet technically gifted striker, Yuya Osako is a rising star of Japanese football. The 24-year-old has shown he can handle the pressures of international football by scoring twice against Australia at the 2013 East Asian Cup, and then finding the net in a friendly against the Netherlands last November.  Osako began his professional career with J.League powerhouse Kashima Antlers, scoring six goals in his first season and quickly becoming a key figure in Kashima\u2019s attack. His 19 goals in 2013 earned him selection to the J.League Best Eleven that season and earmarked him as one of Japan\u2019s most lethal strikers.  In January 2014, Osako was signed by German second-division club 1860 Munich, where he has continued to develop. An admirer of Thierry Henry, Osako\u2019s style of play has shades of the French legend. He will be hoping to unleash his full potential on the pitches of Brazil this summer.  "}, {"Manabu SAITO": "Nicknamed \u201cJapan\u2019s Lionel Messi\u201d in some quarters, midfielder Manabu Saito possesses mesmerising dribbling skills, pace and a clinical finish. He also can play on the wing or wide in midfield, where his jinking runs, pinpoint crosses and ability to slip away from markers make him a real attacking threat.  Saito had been tipped to play at the highest level ever since he joined the Yokohama F Marinos youth academy as a teenager. The 24-year-old has played for Marinos throughout his career, except during 2011, when he was loaned to second-division club Ehime FC. Saito ran out for Japan at several age grades, and also represented his country at the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2007 and the 2012 London Olympics.  The pocket-sized midfielder was first called up to the Samurai Blue at the 2013 East Asian Cup. Saito scored against Australia during that tournament and a string of energetic performances since then have earned him a spot in Japan\u2019s FIFA World Cup team. Though modest in stature, his swift attacking forays into the penalty area and dribbling skills have earned the admiration of former international midfielder and Marinos legend Shunsuke Nakamura. "}, {"PARK Chuyoung": "A clinical finisher with creativity and intelligence, Park Chuyoung is arguably one of the most talented strikers in the history of Korean football. He came to prominence at the 2004 AFC Youth Championship in Malaysia, where he single-handedly led his country to winning their 11th continental title while grabbing the golden boot as well as the Most Valuable Player award in the process. After rounding off the memorable year by winning the Asian Young Player of Year trophy, he joined FC Seoul and finished runner-up in the scoring chart to be later voted unanimously as the Rookie of the Year. His prolific form on the domestic stage earned Park his first cap against Uzbekistan in qualifying for Germany 2006. Although he had played a crucial role in the preliminary competition, his first appearance at the FIFA World Cup\u2122 was not to be a fond memory for Park, who had to wait for his chance sitting on the bench in Korea Republic\u2019s first two matches before coming out empty handed in a 2-0 defeat by Switzerland. After undergoing a lengthy slump at his club, Park tried his luck in the French Ligue 1 with Monaco in the summer of 2008 before taking part in the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament. While he was adapting to the French top flight, Park had a successful qualifying campaign for South Africa 2010. The Watford man went on to break his duck at the finals, scoring off a free-kick in a 2-2 draw with Nigeria that secured a place in the round of 16. Park was also a key member of Hong Myungbo\u2019s charges at the Asian Games later that year and the 2012 Men\u2019s Olympic Tournament where the Taeguk Warriors finished third and won the bronze medal respectively. "}, {"LEE Keunho": "Lee Keunho is a livewire forward whose quick thinking and good positioning in front of goal have made him one of the most feared strikers in Asian football. With his deft footwork and unpredictable shots, Lee is a constant menace to opposing defences. The 29-year-old began his professional career at his hometown club Incheon United in 2005 but it was at Daegu FC where Lee came into prominence, scoring 23 goals in 59 matches in all competitions over two seasons. After a successful spell in the J.League with Jubilo Iwata and Gamba Osaka, Lee returned to his homeland to join Ulsan Hyundai in 2012. He led the attack with four goals and six assists as the Tigers won the 2012 AFC Champions League, and rounded off the season by winning the AFC Player of the Year award. Although he narrowly missed out on the squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122, Lee bounced back in style by scoring the last-gasp winner against United Arab Emirates in the third round of qualifying for Brazil 2014. Despite the managerial merry-go-round over the course of the preliminary competition, Lee continued to perform well for the Taeguk Warriors, making 12 appearances in the process. "}, {"KOO Jacheol": "Koo Jacheol is a central midfielder with vision and a sharp eye for goal. The 25-year-old pulls the strings in the middle of the park, displaying a talent for orchestrating the game either in an attacking role or as a defensive midfielder. After coming through the ranks at Korea Republic\u2019s youth national teams, Koo joined Jeju United at the age of 18 in 2007. He made his international debut against hosts China PR at the EAFF East Asian Championship in February 2008, before the all-round midfielder captained his country to the quarter-finals of the FIFA U-20 World Cup Egypt 2009 under the guidance of coach Hong Myungbo.\\r\\nAlthough he did not make the squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122, Koo put the disappointment behind him and played an important role as Jeju finished runners-up at the end of the year. Koo came to prominence at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, where he scored five goals to win the golden boot as the Taeguk Warriors finished third at the continental championship. Koo's heroics in Qatar earned him a transfer to German Bundesliga side Wolfsburg, but he subsequently moved on loan to Augsburg where he was given more playing time.\\r\\nThe highlight of his promising career came in the summer of 2012, when Koo captained the Taeguk Warriors at the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament in London. His eye-catching performances in the middle of the park were key to the Taeguk Warriors fairy-tale run to the last four, and despite a 3-0 defeat to Brazil in the semi-final, Koo scored their second goal to seal a 2-0 victory against Japan in the bronze medal match in Cardiff. He also featured in eight matches during the Asian Zone qualifying for Brazil 2014, scoring twice in the process. "}, {"KIM Shinwook": "Towering forward Kim Shinwook has emerged as one of the brightest starlets of Korean football since he made a successful transition from centre-half to striker upon joining K.League giants Ulsan Hyundai in 2009. Under the guidance of former Korea Republic coach Kim Hogon, he scored seven goals in each of his first two seasons at Munsu before helping the Tigers finish runners-up in 2011. Kim also finished as the top scorer with 11 goals in eight matches as Ulsan won the K.League Cup that year. He went on to lift the 2012 AFC Champions League trophy, before winning the K.League Most Valuable Player award despite narrowly missing out on the golden boot with 19 goals last season.\\r\\nAlthough he made his international debut in a friendly with Zambia in the build-up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122, Kim did not make the trip to the tournament itself. But he was a member of the Korea Republic side that finished third at the AFC Asian Cup the following year. Kim also took part in the Asian Zone qualifying for Brazil 2014, during which he scored his first international goal in a 4-1 victory over Qatar on 8 June 2012. "}, {"Raul JIMENEZ": "Mexican football\u2019s latest sensation, America striker Raul Jimenez was scarcely on the radar of  fans when he was called up to the national team for the Men's Olympic Football Tournament London 2012. There his opportune appearances from the bench not only played a key part Mexico\u2019s triumph, it also raised his profile significantly. In the intervening years, this towering forward has gone from strength to strength.  He helped Club America win the Clausura 2013 title and reach the final in the ensuing Apertura 2013. But he reached his highest point in the CONCACAF qualifiers where his magnificent scissor-kick goal from outside the box helped Mexico overcome a gritty Panamanian side when everything seemed lost. Renowned for his superb aerial game and imposing physical prowess, this 23-year-old has a knack for getting himself into dangerous positions and is almost certain to play a role at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, even if it is as an impact player coming off the bench. "}, {"Giovani DOS SANTOS": "Few Mexican players have achieved as much at international level as Giovani dos Santos. The talented playmaker won the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2005, picked up a gold medal at the Men's Olympic Football Tournament London 2012, and was voted the third-best young player at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 - all by the age of 24. Yet, for all his success with , dos Santos has struggled to show his best form on a consistent basis at club level. A product of the famous youth set-up at Barcelona,  spent just one year in 's first team before moving to England to join Tottenham Hotspur.\\xa0\\xa0  Playing opportunities in north London proved scarce, however, and his four years as a Tottenham player included loan spells at Ipswich Town, Galatasaray and Racing Santander. Those stints away from White Hart Lane did, at least, allow him to showcase his talents, and reinforced his need to find regular first-team football. His move to Mallorca the start of 2012/13 promised that much-needed stability, and he has duly become an important figure for the team. However, with the Balearic club seemingly destined for relegation from the Spanish top flight \u2013 despite their new recruit's best efforts \u2013 Dos Santos could soon be on the hunt for new employers once again.  With his combination of power, skill and grace, Dos Santos is one player sure to delight the crowds at Brazil 2014. "}, {"Alan PULIDO": "Given a chance to prove himself in friendlies, this raw 23-year-old forward seized the opportunity with both hands, firing a hat-trick past Korea Republic on his senior Mexico debut in January this year as part of a successful late push for a place in the squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil. Pulido's previous international highlight was a third-place finish at the\\xa0FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2011, where his failure to find the net took nothing away from his lively performances. However, going to Brazil should go some way towards burying the attacker's demons from the Men's Olympic Games\\xa0London 2012,\\xa0when the Tigres man missed out on a gold medal after being omitted from the final squad The slippery goalscorer will be bidding to make up for lost time this summer, when he is expected to perform the role of an impact sub. "}, {"Javier HERNANDEZ": "There can now be few football fans around the world who are not familiar with the name Javier '' Hernandez. The Manchester United striker has earned widespread respect for his likeable character, simple approach to the game and, above all, his uncanny knack of popping up with important goals when it really matters. \\xa0 If Hernandez is an important player for his club, then he can be considered absolutely integral to the Mexican national team. The 25-year-old has scored 30 goals in only 46 international games, and appears well on course to smash the all-time record of 42 held by 's legendary former striker Jared Borgetti. \\xa0 It follows, then, that Hernandez will be one of the main attractions in Mexico's squad for the FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil 2013. The coaching staff of Mexico's opponents will be all too aware of his threat, and are no doubt planning ways to negate his pace, predatory finishing and superb sense of positioning in the penalty area. \\xa0 Their efforts will likely be in vain, however, as Hernandez is a player who nearly always finds a way to deliver. The FIFA Confederations Cup is a competition that holds great importance in Mexico, and their fans will be pinning their hopes on a strong contribution from their star striker. "}, {"Oribe PERALTA": "One of the most popular players in Mexican football, Oribe Peralta surged to prominence when scoring the two goals that won gold for  at the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament London 2012, assuring him a place in the country\u2019s footballing history. The Santos Laguna man, who goes by the nickname of  (The Brush), has performed well for the full national team whenever he has been called on, though his rival for a place in the side is none other than Javier Hernandez, who enjoys hero status among Mexico fans. Coach Jose Manuel de la Torre has tried to accommodate both players in a 4-4-2 formation, but with unsatisfactory results so far. Peralta does possess a nose for goal and elusiveness in the box, which make him a very useful alternative for De la Torre. "}, {"Robin VAN PERSIE": "No-one has scored more goals for the Netherlands than Robin van Persie. The Manchester United forward claimed the all-time record in October of last year, surpassing the current assistant coach, Patrick Kluivert, with his 39th, 40th and 41th strikes for the national team in an 8-1 trouncing of Hungary.  That hat-trick was the highlight of a spectacular Brazil 2014 campaign for Van Persie, who scored 11 times in nine appearances to finish as the European Zone\u2019s leading marksman. A trio of assists were thrown in for good measure as this multi-talented striker re-affirmed his central importance to the team being built by Louis van Gaal.  The Netherlands coach underlined his belief in Van Persie by naming him captain last June, stripping Wesley Sneijder of the role, and that controversial decision has been justified in the time since. The Manchester United star has certainly\\xa0improved steadily with age,\\xa0maturing from the raw but\\xa0talented winger first seen at Feyenoord into one of the world\u2019s most accomplished centre-forwards. His goal tally over recent years for club and country reflects that. In 2012/13, he topped the English Premier League goalscoring chart for the second season in succession \u2013 the first player to do so for two different clubs (Arsenal and United) since Three Lions legend Alan Shearer.  He is, though, coming into the FIFA World Cup\u2122 at the end of his most difficult and injury-plagued season in some time, with United\u2019s struggles widely attributed to the infrequency of his appearances. Van Persie will also be keen to improve on his scoring record at major finals, having endured a miserable UEFA EURO 2012 and been less than prolific at his previous three EURO and World Cup outings. \\r\\nBut with Van Gaal set to make him the focal point of the Dutch attack, the smart money would be on the Oranje\u2019s record goalscorer adding a few more to his tally on Brazilian soil.  "}, {"Arjen ROBBEN": "Brazil 2014 will be Arjen Robben\u2019s sixth major tournament for the Netherlands and, at 30, he remains one of the team\u2019s key players. Speed, dribbling ability and a deadly left foot have established the Bayern Munich winger as one of the most exciting talents of his generation, and Louis van Gaal \u2013 like so many of his predecessors \u2013 puts a high value on his importance.  Robben\u2019s favoured method of attack, drifting in from the right wing to shoot on his favoured side, is so well known as to seem almost predictable. But stopping him continues to prove consistently difficult. It is not for nothing that three of Europe\u2019s most successful clubs\\xa0- Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich\\xa0- have paid a combined \u20ac75 million to acquire his services, with Robben proving a success in every league in which he has played.  He first came to the world\u2019s attention while with PSV Eindhoven, and it was during his time with the Dutch giants that he gained his first taste of international football. The winger was just 20 when he was named in Dick Advocaat\u2019s squad for UEFA EURO 2004, and even then showed the ability and character that would keep him in the Dutch line-up for years to come.  South Africa 2010 was arguably his best tournament to date, with Robben\u2019s dynamic performances for the finalists reflected by his place among the nominees for the adidas Golden Ball. Cruelly, though, his contribution to that FIFA World Cup is often best remembered for a crucial miss in the deciding match against Spain, and he was lampooned in 2012 after failing to convert a potentially match-winning penalty for Bayern Munich in the Champions League final against Chelsea.  Robben, though, is made of stern stuff and he secured redemption last year with the winning goal as Bayern made up for that 2012 disappointment with victory over Borussia Dortmund in the same fixture. The Dutch will now hope that this outstanding player can help write a better ending to their 2014 story than the fairy tale-turned-tragedy of South Africa.  "}, {"Dirk KUYT": "At 33, and with his 34th birthday beckoning just nine days after the Brazil 2014 Final, Dirk Kuyt is one of the Netherlands\u2019 elder statesmen. Though not blessed with the natural skill of team-mates such as Robben, Sneijder and Van Persie, the veteran forward has been a favourite of successive coaching regimes due to the selflessness and tirelessness of his performances.  Kuyt, having made his debut under Marco van Basten in 2004, has a decade of international experience behind him and is currently closing in on his 100th cap. He was certainly a key player for the Dutch at South Africa 2010, when he started all seven games, including the Final, contributing a goal, three assists and boundless effort to the Netherlands\u2019 excellent campaign.  The former Liverpool and Feyenoord forward\u2019s international career looked to be drawing to a close when he lost his place in the team at UEFA EURO 2012, and soon after was removed as vice-captain by Louis van Gaal. However, while he is not a guaranteed starter these days, Kuyt continues to prove his worth and made five appearances during the Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign. Van Gaal will know only too well that, in this committed and unfussy performer, he has the most dependable of stalwarts.  "}, {"Jeremain LENS": "With five goals in nine Brazil 2014 qualifiers, Jeremain Lens was one of the stars of the Netherlands\u2019 impressive preliminary campaign. The 26-year-old\u2019s performances, allied to his versatility, make him a certainty to feature in Louis van Gaal\u2019s squad and someone who could well play a key role at the FIFA World Cup itself.  It could all have been so different for Lens, who in 2009 declared his intention to play for Suriname, competing for his adopted nation in the PARBO Bier Cup. Fortunately, as the tournament did not take place under FIFA\u2019s auspices, the Amsterdam-born forward and former Dutch U-21 international remained eligible for the country of his birth \u2013 and the call came in 2010.  Lens\u2019 name was one of those cut from Bert van Marwijk\u2019s provisional squad for that year\u2019s World Cup, although the appointment of Louis van Gaal \u2013 his former coach at AZ \u2013 has resulted in him becoming a regular. This pacey and direct forward, who can play anywhere across the front line and as a No10, also completed the first overseas move of his career last year, joining Dynamo Kiev from PSV Eindhoven for a reported \u20ac15million. He is sure to be a player well worth watching at Brazil 2014.  "}, {"Klaas Jan HUNTELAAR": "With 34 goals in 60 international appearances, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar boasts a goalscoring record of which any top-class striker would be proud. Yet despite these figures, and his place among the top ten marksmen in his country\u2019s history, this is a player who has rarely been the Netherlands\u2019 first-choice No9.  His misfortune has been\\xa0to coincide with Robin van Persie, the man who tops that all-time scoring list, and the player who outscored all others in the European Zone qualifiers for Brazil 2014. Nonetheless, Huntelaar\\xa0- as the statistics show \u2013 has proved himself to be a more than adequate deputy whenever he has been called upon.  Louis van Gaal clearly values the Schalke star as a penalty box predator, and though he played just twice during the Netherlands\u2019 preliminary campaign, he was still able to contribute two goals and an assist. Then again, finding the net has rarely proved a problem for Huntelaar in a career that has already brought him over 200 goals for both club and country.  Beloved by fans of AGOVV, Heerenveen and Ajax in his homeland, where his scoring ratio was close to a goal-a-game, the striker made the first big move of his career in 2009 when Real Madrid paid \u20ac20 million to take him to the Bernabeu. While his scoring record remained respectable, Madrid opted to offload him within a year, and a \u20ac15 million switch to AC Milan proved similarly unfulfilling.  It was only when Huntelaar agreed a move to Schalke in 2010\\xa0- with \u20ac14 million the fee on this occasion\\xa0- that he finally found a home, and began to rediscover the form that had made him one of Europe\u2019s sought-after strikers. Already into the top five of the Gelsenkirchen club\u2019s all-time leading marksmen, he finished as the Bundesliga\u2019s top scorer in 2011/12 with 29 goals and remains a dependable match-winner.  "}, {"Memphis DEPAY": "One of the Netherlands\u2019 rising stars, 20-year-old Memphis Depay made a late push for a FIFA World Cup\u2122 place on the back of a tremendous season for PSV Eindhoven. Speed, trickery and a powerful shot have already led to the young forward being likened to Arjen Robben and Eden Hazard, and Louis van Gaal has recognised his potential with a handful of senior appearances.  Though right-footed, he it utilised most often on the left flank as an inverted winger, a position from which he utilised his speed and skill to cut inside and unleash ferocious strikes on goal. Set pieces are also a speciality, and Depay\\xa0- who plays with a self-assurance that belies his age\\xa0- will no doubt be jostling with Messrs Van Persie and Sneijder for free-kick opportunities should the opportunity arise.  Disciplinary problems plagued the early part of his career, but with those issues seemingly put behind him at PSV, Depay\\xa0- who was also eligible for Ghana through his\\xa0father - is emerging as one of the most sought-after young players in European football. If he can bring his explosive talents to the World Cup and cap a spectacular season, the hype around this exciting young Dutchman is sure to reach new levels.  "}, {"Ahmed MUSA": "Twenty-one year old\\xa0Ahmed Musa is another of the massively talented Nigerian youngsters who seem destined to take the Super Eagles to success for years to come.  A speedy forward who can slot in anywhere along the front line, he gained experience starring for the Flying Eagles at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2011. Musa is rated so highly by coach Stephen Keshi that he was one of just three players in the Super Eagles team that featured in all eight 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifiers. He also held his own in five of six matches as Nigeria won the CAF Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 and played in all three of Nigeria's matches at last year's FIFA Confederations Cup. \\r\\nThese impressive national team experiences have also been supplemented by a successful career so far in European club football. Musa moved to the Netherlands in 2010 with to play for VVV-Venlo at just 18, and once he started playing in the Eredivisie it was only a matter of time before bigger clubs came calling. Despite interest from throughout Europe, he moved to CSKA Moscow two years ago, and since then has established himself as one of the best young players in the Russian Premier League. "}, {"Peter ODEMWINGIE": "Peter Odemwingie's inclusion in the Super Eagles' squad for Brazil sees the Russian-born striker return to the team for the first time for over a year. Odemwingie, who has a Russian mother and a Nigerian father, was not picked again after making his disappointment at being dropped from Nigeria's 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations squad public. He was, however, recalled by Stephen Keshi into the extended squad for Brazil and then came on as a substitute in Nigeria's 2-2 draw against Scotland at the end of May. Keshi's decision to pick the Stoke City player, who scored six goals in 15 outings for the English Premier League club this year, is a sign of the confidence that Keshi has in Odemwingie's scoring abilities. The former Lokomotiv Moscow forward gives Keshi plenty of options upfront as he can be used in just about any position: as the only striker, a support striker, wide on either flank or even in midfield, where he can use his creativity to create plays. He first played for Nigeria in 2002 and captained the side at the finals of the 2010 AFCON before playing at the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 finals in South Africa. He was also an over-age player in the Nigerian side at the 2008 Olympics, where the side lost in the gold medal match against a Lionel Messi-inspired Argentina. "}, {"Emmanuel EMENIKE": "Striker Emmanuel Emenike is one of several players from west Africa who found their way to Europe via the South African league. The 29-year-old played for Mpumalanga Black Aces and FC Cape Town before being transferred to Turkey, where he signed for Karabukspor, helping the club gain promotion with a good goal return.  Emenike, whose strengths include power and pace, continued scoring with reckless abandon in the top flight, and it was natural that a bigger club would come calling. A dream move to Fenerbahce materialised before he was implicated and later cleared of involvement in a match-fixing scandal, although it led to him being sold to Russian club Spartak Moscow without having played for the Istanbul giants. After spending two seasons in Moscow, where he scored a goal every other game, he transferred back to Fenerbahce before the 2013/14 season and kept up the same scoring rate. His talent has continued to draw interest from clubs in bigger leagues, and a breakout FIFA World Cup would do his prospects no harm. Since breaking into the Nigerian national team in 2011, Emenike has become a valuable member of the impressive side that Stephen Keshi has built. The striker was one of the stand-out players as the Super Eagles won the Africa Cup of Nations for the third time in their history in South Africa last year and even though he had to miss the final through injury, finished joint top scorer of the competition.  He was overlooked for Nigeria's squad for the FIFA Confederations Cup and only returned to national team duty towards the end of Nigeria's 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying campaign. He made an immediate impact though, scoring once as the Super Eagles beat Malawi in a group game and claiming both goals in the vital 2-1 victory in Ethiopia in the play-offs. "}, {"Victor MOSES": " After his club career began like a house on fire, Victor Moses discovered the more difficult side of professional football over the last season \u2013 although his importance to the Super Eagles should not be underestimated. Moses, who plays mostly as a winger, first starred on the global stage in 2007, when he was member of the England squad at the FIFA U-17 World Cup, scoring three times as the country where he was raised in advanced to the quarter-finals. His speed and crossing ability proved valuable enough for him to work his way up the ranks from Crystal Palace to Wigan Athletic and then to giants Chelsea, where he played in the FIFA Club World Cup.   Moses was then in the Nigeria team that won a third African title in South Africa in 2013, but his national team success was followed by a loan move to Liverpool at the beginning of the 2013/4 season. As Liverpool mounted a strong title challenge, Moses struggled to force his way into the starting line-up and was used mainly as a late substitute.  He was a more prominent figure in Stephen Keshi's squad for the FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifiers, playing in six of the country's matches as the Super Eagles kept their momentum up to reach Brazil 2014. Like many of his compatriots, Moses is at a turning point in his career and will be looking to catch the world's attention with his play in Brazil. "}, {"Michael BABATUNDE": "Michael Babatunde is yet another youngster who has received regular call-ups into Stephen Keshi's Nigeria squads, but despite the fact that his stock has continued to rise, he has yet to play in a competitive game for the Super Eagles.  The 21-year-old has already spent over three years playing in the Ukrainian top flight, first for FC Kryvbas Kryvyj Rih and since 2013 for Volyn Lutsk. His impressive performance in the Ukraine did not go unnoticed as the forward was rewarded with a first call-up into the Super Eagles squad for their 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifier against Kenya in March last year and was then also included in the Nigerian squad for the FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil 2013. \\r\\nThe pacy winger, who was born on Christmas Eve 1992, does have some experience in international football, having played on the Nigerian Olympic side that failed to qualify for the London event. He has also turned out for his country at U-17 and U-20 level. He earned his first cap in Nigeria's 2-2 draw against Mexico in an international friendly at the end of May last year.  "}, {"Uche NWOFOR": "Given the fact that Uche Nwofor has seen very little playing time in the Dutch Eredivisie this season, his inclusion in the Super Eagles' FIFA World Cup\u2122 squad for Brazil is somewhat of a surprise.  The striker, who is on loan at Heerenveen from VVV-Venlo, was aided in his attempt to be a squad player for coach Stephen Keshi by an injury to Bright Dike, who was ruled out of contention for the World Cup with an injury. Ironically, Dike had last year replaced the injured Nwofor for two international matches. Nwofor first made a name for himself with Nigeria's U-20 side as the Flying Eagles won the Africa Youth Championship in 2011. He won the top scorer award and was selected for the squad that played in the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Colombia in the same year, scoring twice after coming off the bench in a 5-2 victory against Croatia.  At that stage, he had already been capped once at senior level, and last year, he scored twice as the Super Eagles beat South Africa in the Nelson Mandela Challenge. However, he played just once for his country in the qualifiers as the Super Eagles achieved a second successive appearance at the World Cup finals. "}, {"Okechukwu UCHEBO": "Unlike many of his compatriots, midfielder Michael Uchebo had already been playing in Europe for several seasons before being called up to the Super Eagles. He started his career with Nigerian club Enugu Rangers before being scouted by Dutch club VVV Venlo, with whom he signed a three-year contract in 2010. He soon became an influential player in the team and achieved near cult-status with the fans in 2012 when he scored a late winner in a relegation play-off to keep the club in the top flight. Uchebo, who had been on trials with Stoke City and Rangers earlier, transferred to Belgian club Cercle Brugge in 2012. In Belgium the 24-year-old established himself in the first team and he was rewarded with a call-up for Nigeria's friendly against Mexico in March this year. After keeping his place for the 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 finals squad, Uchebo said that the Super Eagles could be the surprise package in Brazil. \u201cEvery country that has qualified for the finals harbours the dream of winning the tournament. No one should write off Nigeria as we have the talents and quality to succeed at the international level. We are not afraid of any country either small or mighty because with our wealth of experience as players and exposure of our technical crew we will surprise the world in Brazil,\u201d he said. "}, {"Shola AMEOBI": "Although already 32 years old, Shola Ameobi only started playing for the Super Eagles in late 2012, coming on as a late substitute in Nigeria's 3-1 victory against Venezuela.  Born in Nigeria, the striker moved to Newcastle when still a young boy and learnt his footballing skills there. He joined Newcastle United as a youngster and has been with the club ever since, aside from a very brief spell on loan at Stoke City. He played over 20 times for the England U-20 side, but failed to progress to the Three Lions, leaving him eligible for a call up to the Super Eagles. He first declared his interest in playing for the country of his birth in 2009, but had to endure a lengthy wait until a call-up materialised.  Ameobi's two brothers, Tomi and Sammy, are also professional footballers, with Sammy a team-mate at Newcastle. Shola has played over 300 matches for Newcastle \u2013 more than any other member of the 2013/4 squad - but although he managed more than 20 first team appearances in the Premier League this season, he has been little more than a bit-player, often coming on as a late substitute.  It seems likely that he will not be playing for Newcastle next season, and the World Cup could well be the perfect stage to showcase his talents. "}, {"CRISTIANO RONALDO": "Footballs have always played a major role in Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s life. From the time he used to kick them about with his friends on the streets of Madeira to the crowning moments of his career, his two FIFA Player of the Year awards, the Portuguese superstar has had a special relationship with the small spherical object that will bring the world to a standstill during the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122.\\r\\n It is with a ball at his feet that Cristiano Ronaldo has broken just about every record there is to beat. At 29 years of age he has been the top scorer in England, Spain and the UEFA Champions League, before naturally fulfilling his destiny as Portugal\u2019s record goalscorer, overtaking Pauleta\u2019s tally of 47.  Goals have always been the lifeblood of Ronaldo\u2019s career. His dream of becoming a footballer made him leave his family behind him in Madeira at just 12 years of age, and head to the capital in mainland Portugal and Sporting Clube de Portugal. Like most of football\u2019s all-time greats, he made his senior debut at a young age, breaking into the first team at 17, announcing himself with two goals. At the inauguration match of the club\u2019s new Estadio de Alvalade, ahead of the 2003/04 season, his brilliant performance against Manchester United convinced Sir Alex Ferguson to buy him and hand him the mythical No7 shirt of the .  The rest, as they say, is history. He was an idol at Old Trafford for six seasons before breaking the record for the highest transfer fee paid in football history when he switched to Real Madrid in 2009/10. All the while he continued to sparkle for his national team.  He is the first Portuguese footballer to win two FIFA Player of Year awards, surpassing the legendary Eusebio and Luis Figo, became Portugal\u2019s top scorer and this year he and Ricardo Costa will become the first Portuguese players to appear in three World Cups. In Brazil he will be striving to achieve the one objective that has escaped him: winning a trophy for Portugal. \\xa0 \\r\\nAfter finishing as a runner-up at UEFA EURO 2004 and reaching the semi-finals of the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany\u2122, Ronaldo dreams of becoming a world champion. The mythical Estadio do Maracana would certainly be an apt stage for the coronation of a new king of football. "}, {"Hugo ALMEIDA": "For years Portuguese fans have yearned for a centre-forward in the mould of Hugo Almeida: tall, strong, dominant in the air and with a thunderous shot. Almeida has all the qualities you do not find in the archetypal Portuguese striker, and as such the Besiktas marksman gives Paulo Bento a different option.  He came through the ranks at Porto, making his debut at 19, but opportunities were few and far between and a series of loan moves ensued. He found time to leave his mark at Porto though, above all on two occasions that are engraved in the memories of the club\u2019s fans. He netted in the inauguration match of the new Estadio do Dragao, and scored a quite stupendous strike in the UEFA Champions League at Inter Milan.  In 2006/07 he was on loan again, this time at Werder Bremen, and it was in Germany that Almeida came to the fore. The Bundesliga outfit got the best out of the burly striker and they subsequently made the move permanent. He played for Werder for four years, before moving to Besiktas, Turkey.  \\r\\nAlmeida made the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 and has been a regular in the squad ever since, often starting to give Portugal more firepower up front. "}, {"VIEIRINHA": "A regular presence in Paulo Bento\u2019s squads during the qualifiers for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122, Vieirinha\u2019s chances of making the world finals were dealt a major blow when he picked up a serious knee injury in September 2013.\\r\\n Determined not to miss out, he worked tirelessly to get back to full fitness and had made a complete recovery by April. His return did not go unnoticed by Bento, who promptly restored him to the national fold, a sign of how far the player has come in recent years. Denied much of an opportunity at Porto at the start of his career, Vieirinha moved abroad in search of first-team football. He found it in Greece with PAOK, using his speed and technique to great effect in three and a half successful seasons before moving to Wolfsburg of Germany. He continued to develop his game in the Bundesliga, where his performances earned him a call-up to the full national team, having already played for his country at the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2003.  The persevering Vieirinha now has the chance to show what he can do on the biggest stage of all, the reward for his determination to overcome every obstacle he has faced in his career. "}, {"EDER": "Guinea-Bissau born Eder is a classic example of a late bloomer. He only made his debut in the Portuguese top flight at 21 years of age, but today nobody doubts the striker\u2019s talent.  Arriving in Portugal as a three-year-old, he did not have an easy childhood. He first played for  (Sunflower Home), an institution in Coimbra that cares for children at risk and which Eder continues to support and visit today, showing that his success has not made him forget his humble origins.  He signed for Sporting Braga at the start of 2012/13 and shortly afterwards realised his dream of playing for Portugal, in a qualifying match against Azerbaijan for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122.  Portugal seemed to have found another option for their attack, but life had another test lined up for Eder. In March 2013 he tore his ligaments in his right knee, ruling him out of action for six months. When he finally returned he promptly broke a toe.  His World Cup dream looked over, but whatever obstacles life throws his way, Eder has shown tremendous determination to overcome them. He made a full recovery and bounced back to his best form to make the squad for Brazil 2014. "}, {"RAFA": "Twelve months ago Rafa Ferreira Silva would have found it hard to imagine that he would make Paulo Bento\u2019s 23-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122. A lot can change in a year, however, with the Braga midfielder proving his worth in the Portuguese league over the last year and doing enough to convince the national team coach that he deserved the call.\\r\\n Silva made the breakthrough during the 2012/13 season, one he spent with in the second division with Feirense, where his performances attracted the attentions of a clutch of leading sides across Portugal. The race for his signature was won by Braga, with the young midfielder quickly showing exactly why the top-flight outfit had moved for him. Capable of playing an attacking role at the tip of the midfield or as a second striker, Silva is both skilful and versatile, qualities that convinced Paulo Bento to draft the player into his squad for Brazil. \\r\\nThough Silva\u2019s fledgling international career only began once the qualifiers were over, he is one of the brightest prospects in Portuguese football and a player of immense potential. "}, {"NANI": "Nani is yet another product of the veritable conveyor belt of top quality wingers churned out by Sporting\u2019s famed academy. After cheering on and then seeing depart Sporting heroes such as Luis Figo, Simao Sabrosa, Ricardo Quaresma and Cristiano Ronaldo, in 2005/06 fans got to see the most recent world-class wide player sprout from the club\u2019s grass roots.  Born on the African island of Cape Verde, Nani moved to Portugal at a young age and it was sport that moulded his character. As well as football, he practised the Brazilian martial art of capoeira for many years, which afforded him mobility and elasticity, and was where he learned his trademark backflip when celebrating his goals.  His first club was Real Massama, from where Sporting picked him up, and Nani\u2019s outstanding skills saw him successfully ascend through the youth ranks to the professional game. He made his debut for the first team in 2005/06, but his extraordinary quality and competitiveness meant just two years later Manchester United were in for him. In the wake of their successful purchase of Cristiano Ronaldo from Sporting in 2003, the English giants did not think twice about paying a huge transfer fee for another wing wizard from the same club.  Nani\u2019s initial months at United were spent at the home of his new friend, Cristiano Ronaldo, and the winger did not waste time making his mark for the Red Devils. A triumphant first season ended with Premier League and UEFA Champions league winners\u2019 medals.  He has been a fixture in the Portugal side since 2006, playing at UEFA EURO 2008 and EURO 2012, but he has yet to grace the biggest stage of them all. He was selected in Carlos Queiroz\u2019s squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122, but an injury shortly before the tournament forced him out of it. Four years later Nani will finally have the chance to showcase his talent on the biggest football event on the planet. "}, {"VARELA": "At the start of Silvestre Varela\u2019s career his playing style and haircut earned him a nickname that showed how much the fans believed in his ability: 'the Drogba of Caparica'. Varela may be no Drogba, but he has proved to be a useful weapon for Portugal.\\r\\n After first learning his trade for Pescadores da Caparica, he completed his football education at Sporting but never managed to make the breakthrough for the Lions. He was successively loaned out, enjoying excellent spells at Recreativo de Huelva, in Spain, and Estrela da Amadora, back in his home country in 2007/08.  His performances earned him a transfer to Porto and it was in the northern city that he won his first silverware, including several Portuguese Championship titles and the UEFA Europa League in 2011.  Varela has played for Portugal at all the different age-groups, and only missed out on the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 because he broke his fibula a few months before it kicked off. But he was back for EURO 2012, where he played a crucial role in Portugal\u2019s run to the semi-finals, coming off the bench to score the winner against Denmark.  Silvestre Varela now has the chance to shine at a World Cup, where Bento knows he has a secret weapon to call upon if need be. "}, {"Helder POSTIGA": "One of the Portugal\u2019s most experienced forwards, Helder Postiga is preparing to play his second FIFA World Cup\u2122, where he will be gunning to score for the first time in the planet\u2019s biggest football event.\\r\\n The striker\u2019s career is full of highs and lows, and even though he has never won over a significant number of fans, his vast experience and incredible work-rate make him one of the first names on Paulo Bento\u2019s team-sheet.  After coming through the ranks at FC Porto, he made his debut for the Dragons at just 18 years of age, and the following year he was a vital piece in Jose Mourinho\u2019s jigsaw as the Blue and Whites lifted the UEFA Cup. His excellent displays persuaded Tottenham to buy him, and in the summer of 2004 he was in Luiz Felipe Scolari\u2019s squad for the European Championship that Portugal played on home soil.  Two years later Scolari selected him for the 2006 World Cup in Germany where Postiga played three matches, without finding the net, as Portugal finished fourth.  \\r\\nHe did not make the South Africa 2010 squad, but upon the appointment of Paulo Bento as head coach Postiga was brought back into the fold and he was a mainstay of  on the road to Brazil 2014. "}, {"Maksim KANUNNIKOV": "Having watched Russia\u2019s qualification campaign from afar, Maksim Kanunnikov was a surprise late inclusion in Fabio Capello squad for Brazil 2014. The 22-year-old forward had yet to represent his country at senior level when he was named in the Italian\u2019s provisional squad in May, doing enough in Russia\u2019s subsequent warm-up games to convince Capello to take him to Brazil.\\r\\n A seasoned youth international, Kanunnikov made one appearance for Russia at the UEFA Under-21 European Championship 2013 before taking his first steps in the A team in the recent friendlies against Slovakia and Norway. Coming off the bench to join Aleksandr Kokorin in the centre of attack, Kanunnikov did enough to suggest they could form a productive partnership as part of a rejuvenated Russian front line. A Zenit St Petersburg youth product, the front man was loaned out to Tom Tomsk in 2011 and spent last season with Amkar Perm, scoring three goals in total, one of them coming against Zenit. One of the new faces in the Russia squad, Kanunnikov is unlikely to be in line for a starting place in Brazil, though the experience he will acquire could well prove useful in the future, especially with his country set to host the FIFA World Cup\u2122 in four years\u2019 time. "}, {"Alexander KOKORIN": "Much has changed for Aleksandr Kokorin in the last two years. A relative unknown in 2012, the 23-year-old forward is now one of the stars of Fabio Capello\u2019s side and is now aiming to show the world the talent and striking power that helped fire the Russians to Brazil 2014. \\r\\nKokorin has come a long way in a short space of time since the Italian brought him into the side in the wake of UEFA EURO 2012. Handed a starting place in the position filled with some distinction by the equally talented Alan Dzagoev in Poland and Ukraine, the youngster has given fresh impetus to the front line following Andrey Arshavin\u2019s exit from the side. Capello\u2019s faith in him has been rewarded. Tucking in alongside the experienced Alexander Kerzhakov and Alexander Samedov, Kokorin excelled in the qualifiers for Brazil 2014, scoring four times in all \u2013 once in each game against Israel and twice in the 4-1 defeat of Luxembourg. One of those goals against the Israelis, which came after some fine work by Samedov, proved how sharp and opportunistic a finisher he can be and the level of understanding he has built up with his team-mates. His fine performances for his country and for Dinamo Moscow \u2013 the club where he scored his first goal at the age of 17 \u2013 convinced Anzhi Makhachkala to pay a big fee for his services at the start of the 2013 season. Anzhi\u2019s subsequent restructuring meant that within a month he was back at Dinamo, where he remains an idol, a status he is hoping to achieve across the whole nation when he runs out at Brazil 2014. "}, {"Aleksandr KERZHAKOV": "Twelve years on from his fleeting participation at the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan\u2122, Alexander Kerzhakov finds himself back on the big stage in a very different role: a senior player who poses one of the biggest threats in the Russian front line. Restricted to a late appearance in Russia\u2019s ill-fated 2002 campaign, Kerzhakov is now a vital cog in a side that is looking to get beyond the group phase for the first time in its history. \\r\\nThe front man proved his worth in the qualifying competition for Brazil 2014, scoring five goals in all, including his side\u2019s winner in a crucial 1-0 defeat of Portugal. Though 31, Kerzhakov has shown himself to be someone upon whom coach Fabio Capello can rely. The striker has had his ups and downs since his last World Cup appearance, missing out on a place in the Russia squad that reached the semi-finals at UEFA EURO 2008. Though back in the frame the following year, he was sent off as Russia went down to defeat against Slovenia in the South Africa 2010 play-offs. \\r\\nAfter leading the Russian attack under Dick Advocaat in 2011 and appearing at EURO 2012 he has consolidated his place in the side under Capello, and now has Vladimir Beschastnykh\u2019s record as the national team\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer in his sights. He achieved another landmark in October 2013, striking his 208th career goal to become Russian football\u2019s most prolific marksman ever. \\r\\nKerzhakov is something of an idol at Zenit St Petersburg, where he has spent ten seasons in two separate spells, winning the 2010 and 2012 league titles after returning there four years ago. He topped the championship scoring charts in 2004 during the first of his two spells with Zenit and later moved to Sevilla \u2013 where he lifted the UEFA Cup in 2007 \u2013 and Dynamo Moscow before returning to where it all began.

More winner\u2019s medals would come Zhirkov\u2019s way following a move to Chelsea in 2009, with his new employers securing an English league and cup double the following year. In 2011 he was on his way back to Russia, this time to Anzhi Makhachkala, staying there for two years before joining current club Dinamo Moscow. Though a world finals novice, Zhirkov boasts an impressive CV with Russia, having earned more than 50 caps while performing as both full-back and winger on the left flank.

Samedov moved to Lokomotiv Moscow, but did not stick around for long, moving again to Moscow FC, where he enjoyed his first great seasons. But it was after moving again, to city rivals Dynamo that the goals and the assists really began to flow, paving the way for his international debut. And while that long-awaited maiden appearance eventually came in October 2011, it was not in time for the then 27-year-old to make the cut for UEFA EURO 2012. Under Fabio Capello, however, he has become an important member of the national team, playing in eight qualifying games and scoring in both matches against Luxembourg. Samedov has shown excellent recent form too, ending 2013 by scoring in the 1-1 draw with Serbia, and starting 2014 with a decisive contribution in the victory over Armenia. Moreover, he played a leading role in Lokomotiv Moscow\u2019s excellent campaign in the Russian Championship.

Mehmedi spent the majority of his youth career at FC Winthertur, before signing for FC Zurich in 2007. He made his Swiss Super League debut a year later and also helped Zurich win the Blue Stars/FIFA Youth Cup in 2008.

However, Nuremberg's relegation at the end of the campaign prompted Drmic to sign with Bayer Leverkusen, where he will ply his trade after this summer's showcase. Drmic\u2019s goalscoring ability did not go unnoticed by national set-up either and he was part of coach Pierluigi Tami\u2019s team at the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament at London 2012.  His performances there earned him a call-up from Ottmar Hitzfeld for Switzerland\u2019s 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifying match against Albania, while in March this year Drmic netted his first goals for the senior side in a friendly against - of all teams - Croatia. If all goes to plan, more will follow at Brazil 2014. "}, {"Abel HERNANDEZ": "Quick, skilful and incisive, Abel Hernandez is a confident, opportunistic forward who can play through the middle or on either wing, thanks to his ability with both his left and weaker right foot. Hernandez, nicknamed , rose through the youth ranks at Central Espanol and made his first-team debut aged 17. He went on to score 12 goals in 24 games for the club, before earning a fleeting move to Penarol. Indeed, after finishing joint-top scorer in the qualifying tournament for the FIFA U-20 World Cup Egypt 2009, he was on the move again, this time to Palermo in Italy. After scoring once at Egypt 2009, Hernandez got down to work at his new club and gradually began to establish himself in the first team. His progress did not go unnoticed by Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez, who gave him his first senior cap in a friendly against Angola in the build-up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122. Hernandez won the penalty that brought Uruguay's opener, before scoring his first international goal later in the same game.\\xa0 Despite a string of injuries, Hernandez featured in the 2011 Copa America, the Men's Olympic Football Tournament London 2012, and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil. He was also a regular in Uruguay's squad for their Brazil 2014 qualifiers, although he only saw action in their play-off second leg against Jordan.\\xa0 "}, {"Luis SUAREZ": "An opportunistic, predatory finisher with a competitive, not to say fiery streak, the 27-year-old Luis Suarez is now recognised as one of the world\u2019s best strikers. A born leader at his club side Liverpool, where he has garnered countless compliments after an amazing season, he is also an undisputed first choice for his country. Nicknamed \\xa0, Suarez was only 18 when he made his debut for Nacional. In his one and only complete season with the Montevideo club he struck 12 goals to help fire them to the 2006 Uruguayan league title, at which point he moved to Dutch side Groningen. His new club refused to release him for the qualifying competition for the FIFA U-20 World Cup Canada 2007, though within a month Oscar Tabarez had given him his full international debut in a friendly against Colombia, a game in which he was sent off with five minutes remaining. The scorer of 14 goals in 35 games for Groningen, Suarez then made the move to Dutch giants Ajax, scoring two goals for his country at Canada 2007 before the deal went through. It came as no surprise when Tabarez handed him a starting place in the qualifiers for South Africa 2010, Suarez being the only player to figure in 19 of the 20 games and ending the competition as his side\u2019s second-highest scorer with five goals. After enjoying the most prolific season of his club career with Ajax, amassing 49 goals in 48 appearances, the front-man had plenty to say for himself in South Africa, playing in six of Uruguay\u2019s seven games and chipping in with three goals. \\xa0 Suarez had moved to Liverpool by the time he made a four-goal contribution to  win at the 2011 Copa America, where he was named player of the tournament, although he failed to find the back of the net in three outings at the Men\u2019s Olympic Football Tournament London 2012. He has been back in among the goals lately for his country. He scored three goals for Uruguay at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil and 11 for \\xa0during their Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign, finishing atop of the goalscorers list, a feat he repeat for his club as he helped them to a second place finish in England. "}, {"Diego FORLAN": "At 35, Diego Forlan already has his own chapter in Uruguayan football history. He holds the distinction of being Uruguay's most-capped player of all time, and has been an integral part of the set-up throughout the reign of current coach Oscar Tabarez. Hard-working, technically gifted and a lethal finisher, Forlan is known first and foremost as a centre-forward, although in recent times he has also enjoyed success in a deeper, more creative role. Forlan played tennis until the age of 14, but there was never really any doubt that he would end up as a footballer. Indeed, his father played in two FIFA World Cups\u2122, in England in 1966 and Germany in 1974, while his maternal grandfather coached Uruguay at Chile 1962. At the age of 18, Forlan made his professional debut for Argentinian side Independiente, for whom he went on to score 40 goals in 91 appearances. That impressive record earned him a move to Manchester United, but, despite winning three trophies, he never quite matched his previous form and eventually joined Villarreal. His time in Spain could not have been more different. In his first season with Villarreal, Forlan hit 25 goals to finish top of the Spanish scoring charts and claim the European Golden Shoe. He achieved that same double feat again in 2008/09, after finding the net 35 times for Atletico Madrid. Forlan's international career began in 1999 at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Nigeria, where he scored once. He made his senior debut for Uruguay under Victor Pua in early 2002 and played at Korea/Japan 2002, his first FIFA World Cup finals, just a few months later, scoring in his only appearance. Since then, Forlan has been an ever-present for the national team. He scored six times in the preliminaries for Germany 2006, but it was not enough to take Uruguay to the finals. Tabarez then arrived as head coach, but Forlan continued to play a leading role, scoring seven goals to finish as  leading marksman in qualifying for South Africa 2010. The high point of Forlan's career to date came at South Africa 2010, where he picked up the adidas Golden Ball award as the tournament's best player. His five goals helped fire Uruguay to a fourth-place finish, their best performance at a FIFA World Cup finals since Mexico 1970. And, as if that were not enough, his goal against Germany in the match for third place was voted goal of the tournament by users of . After winning the 2011 Copa America, Forlan struggled for playing time at Inter Milan and subsequently returned to South America. He now plays for Japanese side Cerezo Osaka.\\xa0 Even though he recently lost his starting role with Uruguay, Forlan has adapted to Tabarez\u2019s needs, contributing one goal during their fourth place showing at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil and two during their Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign.\\xa0 \\xa0 "}, {"Cristhian STUANI": "A Uruguay player at various age levels, Cristian Stuani had to bide his time before getting his chance with the full national team, which eventually came in October 2012, just days after he turned 26. Known as , his hometown, Stuani is a classic penalty-box striker who makes the most of his strong physical presence and sharp positional sense to cause a threat both in the air and on the ground. A debutant with Danubio at the age of 17, he made his first real impact as a goalscorer in the second division with Bella Vista, for whom he scored 12 goals in 14 games. The goals kept coming on this return to Danubio, Stuani helping himself to another 19 in 14 outings for the club in the 2007/08 season. Those impressive statistics led to a move to Reggina. Failing to make a mark in Italy, he was loaned out to Spanish clubs Albacete, Levante and Racing Santander, scoring 41 goals in 101 games before being bought by Espanyol, his current employers. Twice an unused squad member, Stuani was finally handed his first cap by Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez in a friendly against Poland and was on the bench for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 qualifier against Chile in March. Though he sat that game out, and also at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil, Stuani appears to have now earned the confidence of \\xa0He collected important minutes towards the end their Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign, scoring an important goal against Colombia and another against Jordan at the continental play-off. "}, {"Edinson CAVANI": "Composed, opportunistic and a lethal finisher, Edinson Cavani has shown since joining Paris Saint-Germain that he has all the attributes of a born goalscorer. His imposing physique makes him a dangerous aerial threat, while his skill and reading of the game allows him to play anywhere in attack and even in midfield, as he has done more than once for Uruguay. , as Cavani is known, made his professional debut at 19 for Danubio. In total he scored 12 times for the club, and won the Uruguayan league title with them in 2006/07. In early 2007 he represented the Uruguay U-20s at the South American Youth Championship, where he scored seven goals to help his side qualify for the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada. Cavani had little time to celebrate that success, and on his 20th birthday he flew to Italy to join Palermo. It took him some time to settle, however, as he managed just two goals for his new club in the second half of the season, and found the net only once at Canada 2007. Oscar Tabarez gave Cavani his full international debut in a friendly against Colombia in early 2008, and the striker duly marked the occasion with a goal. Cavani then featured throughout Uruguay's qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122, but failed to score in any of his seven appearances. His contribution, nonetheless, earned him a starting role in six of Uruguay's seven games at South Africa 2010, and he scored his only goal of the tournament in 's defeat in the match for third place. Cavani scored 15 times in his final two seasons with Palermo, but it was not until he joined Napoli that the goals really started flowing, winning the Serie A scoring title during the 2012/13 season before his multi-million transaction to France As well as becoming a fans' idol by breaking the 30-goal mark (in all competitions) in each of his three seasons to date, he is now also Napoli's all-time leading scorer in European football. Since winning the 2011 Copa America, and more recently representing Uruguay at the Men's Olympic Football Tournament London 2012 as one of their three over-age players and at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil, Cavani has continued to play a pivotal role for Tabarez. He was the only player to have appeared in every one of 's Brazil 2014 qualifiers, scoring five goals during the campaign.\\xa0 "}, {"Clint DEMPSEY": "A striker with an indomitable personality and a will to win unrivaled by any in the game, Clint Dempsey is an icon of USA's national team. According to many, he is the team\u2019s beating heart. He has it all: goal-scoring panache, a creative, play-making sensibility, and a grim desire to chase back when a foray breaks down. Dempsey\u2019s one of only three Americans to score in multiple FIFA World Cups\u2122 and he is hoping to make Brazil 2014 \u2013 likely his last world finals \u2013 a special moment. \\r\\nHe began his club career in Major League Soccer, earning Rookie of the Year honours with New England Revolution, before heading for Fulham of the English Premier League. He had a hugely successful series of seasons at Craven Cottage, where he became the club\u2019s all-time top-scorer in the Premier League and led them to an unprecedented UEFA Europa League final, though Atletico Madrid came out on top 2-1 to take the crown. His general play and output in front of goal earned him a chance with crosstown London glamour club Tottenham Hotspur, where he was unfortunate not to break into the first-team on a regular basis, necessitating a huge-money return to MLS with Seattle Sounders in 2013. \\r\\nDempsey has been voted three times as US Soccer\u2019s Player of the Year and scored the team\u2019s only goal of an ill-fated Germany 2006 campaign. He can play as an out-and-out striker, dropped in behind the front-men or even out on a wider perch, making him a useful and crucial cog for the Americans. \u201cI play with a lot of heart and every time I go out on the field I do all I can to help get that win,\u201d Dempsey, whose temperament and character are a perfect fit for his national team, told . \u201cWe work hard as a team and we need that to not change if we\u2019re going to achieve.\u201d "}, {"Aron JOHANNSSON": "Aron Johannsson may be young and new to the USA fold, but coach Jurgen Klinsmann has a great deal of faith in this unknown striker. He packs pace and goal-scoring acumen and possesses the ability to play as an out-and-out No9 or wide on the wing if circumstances should require. \\r\\nJohannson was born in Alabama while his parents were traveling students and returned to Iceland at the age of three. Johannsson showed an early aptitude on the football pitch and he began his club career in Iceland with Fj\u00f6lnir before moving on to AGF Aarhus in Denmark, where he scored 23 goals in 65 appearances for the club. The youngster\u2019s scorching form led to a move to Dutch football and AZ Alkmaar, where he partnered for a time with now international team-mate Jozy Altidore in attack. \\r\\nDespite offers to play for Iceland\u2019s national team, who reached the European qualifying play-offs for Brazil 2014, Johannsson chose instead to align himself with his birth nation, bringing a smile to the face of Klinsmann and a much-needed goal-scoring threat off the bench for the  ahead of the world finals in Brazil. "}, {"Jozy ALTIDORE": "Jozy Altidore is an enigmatic striker. His brawny build and physical power make him a nightmare for defenders with his back to goal, and his ability to hold the ball up and bring teammates into the play is as good as any in the world. While questions have been raised about his commitment and output, Altidore seems to have found his proper rhythm under current  coach Jurgen Klinsmann. \\r\\nYoung Altidore made history when he moved to Spain\u2019s La Liga in 2008 to try his luck with Villarreal. But the dream of becoming the first American to star in one of Europe\u2019s top leagues faded as he found himself shipped out on a series of season-long loans. He revived his fortunes with a move to the Netherlands and AZ Alkmaar, where he scored 39 goals in 67 appearances and helped the club to a rare Dutch Cup crown. His prolific form in the Lowlands brought a much-anticipated move to English Premier League side Sunderland at the start of the current campaign, where Altidore has, once again, struggled to find consistent playing time or form.\\r\\nAfter being dropped by Klinsmman for a pair of games early in the Brazil 2014 qualifying cycle, Altidore regained his focus. He ended a long scoring drought and showed the kind of intensity that makes coaches drool and defenders lose sleep. He refined his game over the course of the CONCACAF qualifying , adding positional sense and increased work-rate to his bag of tricks.  While sharpening his own game to a razor's edge, he expects the same from his mates in the US side ahead of his second FIFA World Cup\u2122. \u201cWe\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re battling together as a team,\u201d Altidore told . \u201cWe need to be a hard team to beat.\u201d  "}, {"Chris WONDOLOWSKI": "A scoring sensation in Major League Soccer, the humble and soft-spoken Chris Wondolowski could prove a dangerous threat off the bench for Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s USA team at the world finals in Brazil.
