In 2009, the French-born goalkeeper then packed his bags for the country of his parents, spending four seasons with Bejaia until he signed terms with Constantine at the start of the 2013/14 campaign. Renowned for his penalty-stopping skills, the 29-year-old first gained international recognition in 2009, when he was invited to an Algeria training camp ahead of qualifying games for the 2011 CAF African Nations Championship. He was handed his maiden cap the following year, in a friendly against Niger.  Si Mohamed's high-quality performances earned him inclusion in the squad for the 2011 African Nations Championship, where Algeria finished fourth. He was also selected for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, though he had to content himself with playing understudy to Rais M'Bolhi. Despite his fine displays in the Algerian league, Si Mohamed looks set to serve as third-choice custodian for  at Brazil 2014, with M'Bolhi boasting vital experience and Mohamed Lamine Zemamouche having played more of a role during the qualifying campaign.

He made his international debut in 2010 and earned a squad place at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations the same year. During the finals, he played in the play-off for third place against Nigeria, having come on for the last few minutes of Algeria's last-four joust with Egypt following Faouzi Chaouchi's dismissal. Born in the Algerian town of Mila, Zamamouche started his professional career at USM Alger, helping the club win the Algerian title in 2003 and 2005 and finish runners-up in 2004 and 2006. He also lifted the Algerian Cup in 2003 and 2004, in addition to a pair of final losses. Zamamouche's spell with the capital side likewise yielded a run to the semi-finals of the 2003 CAF Champions League, where they were beaten by eventual winners Enyimba. Six years later, he signed for MC Alger, where he enjoyed another title triumph in 2010 before returning to his old club in 2011 and winning the 2013 UAFA Club Cup. "

Born in France to a Congolese father and Algerian mother, M'Bolhi began his career at Marseille, where he made just one competitive appearance before his contract expired in 2006. From there, he took his talents to Heart of Midlothian in Scotland, only to experience further frustration on the sidelines. M'Bolhi was finally given a chance to prove himself in Greece for Ethnikos Piraeus, and just five games later he signed terms with Panetolikos. In 2008, he then packed his bags for Japan and a spell at Ryukyu, though he returned to Europe the following season to join Slavia Sofia. After catching the eye at South Africa 2010, M'Bolhi took in a pair of loan stints with CSKA Sofia, either side of a short stay at Russian outfit Krylya Sovetov Samara. Subsequently loaned out to French club GFC Ajaccio, the custodian returned to CSKA Sofia on a permanent deal in summer 2013. M'Bolhi represented France at U-16 and U-17 level in his youth, but he opted to wear Algeria's colours after being called up by Rabah Saadane ahead of the 2010 World Cup. Three years later, he bolstered his major tournament experience at the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations. "

Though few chances came his way with his club, that did not prevent him from excelling at the FIFA U-20 World Cup Canada 2007, where he conceded just two goals in helping Argentina take the title. His displays in Canada paved the way for a move to Dutch outfit AZ Alkmaar. After making the No1 spot his own there, he then won gold at the Men’s Olympic Football Tournament Beijing 2008, where he was called into the starting line-up by coach Sergio Batista to replace the injured Oscar Ustari. He won his first full cap for his country under Diego Maradona, who named him for a vital South Africa 2010 qualifying match against Paraguay in 2009. He has remained his country’s first-choice custodian since then, playing in all five of Argentina’s matches at the last world finals, all four at the 2011 Copa America and in 12 of their 14 qualifiers for Brazil 2014. During that time Romero went 27 games without experiencing defeat, a record for an Argentina goalkeeper. "

It is those qualities that helped him become the first-choice custodian at the three clubs he has played for and to win at least one title with each of them. Getting this far has been no easy task for Orion, who had to wait for four years at the start of his career before nailing down a regular first-team slot at San Lorenzo, the club where he learned his trade. His fine performances in 2007 earned a call-up from the then national team coach Alfio Basile for that year’s Copa America in Venezuela, though he did not play. After winning the league with  , Orion signed for Alejandro Sabella’s Estudiantes, where he collected another championship winner’s medal. In the middle of 2011 he moved to Boca Juniors and enjoyed an exceptional debut season with the Buenos Aires giants, landing another league title and conceding only six goals in the process, a record for the short-tournament format in Argentina. In November that year Sabella handed him his international debut, giving him starts in back-to-back  against Brazil.

        "Mariano ANDUJAR": "Perfectly built for his position, Mariano Andujar boasts all the attributes an international goalkeeper needs: feline reflexes, fine positional sense and bags of character. A product of the youth academy at Huracan, the club closest to his heart and for whom he made his debut in 2003, Andujar tried his luck in Italian football with Palermo before returning home to win a league title with Estudiantes. It was at this stage that he got his first call for national duty, with Alfio Basile drafting him into the squad in November 2007 for two South Africa 2010 qualifying matches, though he saw no action in either of them.  Diego Maradona gave him his international debut in the same competition, against Colombia in 2009. Though he retained his place in the side for the next two games, he was replaced by Sergio Romero following the defeat to Brazil in Rosario, and remained an understudy at the World Cup the following year and at the 2011 Copa America. Current  coach Alejandro Sabella knows all about Andujar’s gifts having been his coach at Estudiantes. Together they won the Copa Libertadores in 2009, with the keeper going 800 minutes without conceding a goal, a new record for the tournament. Though he has been part of the Argentina set-up since Sabella took over, Andujar, who is now with Catania, made only two appearances in the qualifiers for Brazil 2014, right at the start of the campaign.

Though only 22 Ryan is very much in the mix to fill the huge gap left by the surprise international retirement of Mark Schwarzer late last year.  After three successful seasons with Central Coast Mariners, the Sydneysider has greatly enhanced his international aspirations with a strong and highly consistent season at Club Brugge, with the Belgian club boasting a long tradition of Australian players dating back to Frank Farina in the late 1980s.  A dedicated professional with a strong character, Mat Ryan excelled in the A-League winning the competition’s Young Player of the Year award in successive seasons, also claiming the goalkeeper of the year award once. He describes Schwarzer as a “childhood hero”, and also hails the contribution of Mariners’ goalkeeper coach John Crawley who spent several years of his own career in Chile, one of Australia’s Group B opponents.  He debuted for Australia in late 2012, and significantly was handed the No1 jersey for the first two matches of Ange Postecoglou’s reign, performing with distinction in each. "

Langerak is a highly accomplished shot-stopper capable of making spectacular saves. Tall and lean in build he is a dedicated and enthusiastic trainer, committed to improving himself.  Now 25, Langerak has now spent four years as No2 behind Roman Weidenfeller at German Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund. Nevertheless he is highly rated by Borussia coach Jurgen Klopp and has stepped into the first team on several high-profile occasions, performing with distinction. Many of his Borussia appearances have been in demanding environments. He notably made a winning Bundesliga debut in the 2010/11 season at the home of rivals Bayern Munich, coming on as a first-half substitute as Borussia defeated the same opponent in the 2012 German Cup final.  Raised in the rural Queensland town of Bundaberg, Langerak received his first senior national team call-up for the international against, ironically enough, Germany in 2011.

Indeed, he has claimed the A-League goalkeeper of the year crown in four of the past eight seasons since moving from his hometown of Melbourne.  Though not possessing an obvious physical presence, Galekovic is a reliable high-quality shot-stopper and his numerous seemingly impossible saves would make for a stunning career highlights reel. Galekovic’s form helped Adelaide to several successful runs in the AFC Champions League, including an unlikely run to the 2008 final, easily the best performance by an Australian club to date.\\r\\n He was Australia’s third choice goalkeeper at South Africa 2010 having earned a late call-up following Brad Jones’ eleventh-hour withdrawal for personal reasons. Though left on the bench in South Africa, Galekovic did feature in all four matches for Australia at the 2004 Olympic Football Tournament in Athens.

Having conquered Belgium, Courtois then looked further afield to continue his development, with Chelsea luring him to Stamford Bridge. The Premier League giants immediately loaned him out to Atletico Madrid, and Courtois helped  lift the UEFA Europa League in 2012, while emerging as one of the keenest new talents on the Spanish scene. No goalkeeper conceded fewer goals in 2012/13, and Courtois\\'s heroics also helped his side claim the Copa del Rey. This season he followed up those achievements with a La Liga winners medal and a runners-up medal in the UEFA Champions League.\\r\\nSuch performances were regarded with glee and expectation back in his homeland, and the player nicknamed Tarantula showed all his trademark composure as he made his international bow in a goalless draw with France in November 2011.

Five fruitful years later, with the Belgian Goalkeeper of the Year award tucked under his belt, he crossed the English Channel to try his luck at Sunderland.\\r\\nThe three seasons that he spent in the north-east of England only served to confirm his shot-stopping skills, which had already seen him represent Belgium in various youth categories.

        "Asmir BEGOVIC": "Asmir Begovic has rocketed from the English lower-leagues into one of the most coveted goalkeepers in Europe in recent years. The admiring glances Real Madrid, Manchester City and Manchester United have paid the Bosnia-Herzegovina No1, and his authorative performances in 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ qualifying, are testament to that.  Begovic’s family – his father was an ex-keeper – fled war-torn Bosnia when he was an infant. He was brought up in Germany and Canada, whom he represented at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2007.  Begovic had joined Portsmouth three years earlier but, after multiple flitting loan spells, finally made his Premier League debut for Pompey in 2009. The following year, aged 21, he signed Stoke for £3.25m and, after unseating Thomas Sorensen during 2010/11, began the next season as the Potters’ first-choice between the sticks.  It proved a breakout campaign for Begovic, who finished it as Stoke’s player of the year and as the first defensive player to win Bosnia’s annual Idol of the Nation award. The 6ft 6ins keeper’s fine form continued in 2013/14, catching the eye with some superb saves and a goal, from 97.5 yards, after just 13 seconds against Southampton.  \"I firmly believe Asmir has proven over the last few years that he\\'s the best goalkeeper in the Premier League,” said Stoke chairman Peter Coates as some of Europe’s biggest clubs circled.  Begovic had yet to made his senior bow for Canada, despite being included in a couple of squads, when he agreed to switch allegiances to Bosnia-Herzegovina. The man who grew up idolizing Oliver Kahn debuted for his birth nation in late-2009, quickly established himself as their first-choice, and produced wonderful displays in the Brazil 2014 preliminaries, particularly in a 0-0 draw in Greece and a 2-1 win in Slovakia.

Fejzic uses his 6ft 6in frame to command his area. He also possesses sharp reflexes for someone of his size.  After a few years of largely warming benches at Stuttgarter Kickers and Greuther Furth, Fejzic got his breakthrough during a two-year loan spell at Eintracht Braunschweig from 2007. He saw little action upon his return to Greuther, but after coming on as a substitute in a DFB-Pokal semi-final against Borussia Dortmund, Ilkay Gundogan's shot with six seconds remaining cannoned back off the post on to Fejzic’s head and went into the net.\\r\\nHe transferred to VfR Aalen in 2012 and, after confining Daniel Bernhardt to the bench, impressed during the 2013/14 German second flight.

The reason for this is the presence of Asmir Begovic, Bosnia-Herzegovina’s undisputed first-choice between the sticks, but coach Safet Susic has described the deputy as someone he “wouldn’t hesitate to call upon”.  Avdukic, born in the former Yugoslavia in 1981, began his career with Celik Zenica – the first of six clubs from six Bosnian cities he would defend. Avdukic also played for Kamen Ingrad in the Croatian top tier and on loan at Iranian giants Persepolis. The 6ft 3ins keeper helped the latter reach the last 16 in the AFC Champions League 2012, performing superbly in a 3-0 win over Al-Gharafa in Doha.  Avdukic’s best season in his homeland came when he captained Borac Banja Luka to Bosnian Premier League glory in 2011, keeping an incredible 19 clean sheets in 30 games along the way.

In 2005, it was time for a change of scenery. The goalkeeper signed for Inter Milan, only to be loaned out to Chievo Verona, for whom he never played a game.

Yet Victor missed out on the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™, despite having been selected for Brazil’s Confederations Cup squad a year earlier. “Of course I was disappointed, but it also made me try even harder,” he told . Mano Menezes, who had been his coach at Gremio, selected him for his first squad after that World Cup, but Menezes was fired in 2012, and in the same year Victor was surprisingly transferred to Atletico Mineiro. Such changes seemed to cause his international stock to fall. He did not allow his head to drop, however, and was one of the heroes of Atletico’s victorious Copa Libertadores campaign last year, when he caught the eye of current Brazil manager Scolari. “In football you have to be consistent for both your club and the national team. You need to play well for one to guarantee your place in the other,” he said.

        "Claudio BRAVO": "Not many goalkeepers can say that they have a street named after them, though that is exactly the honour bestowed on Claudio Bravo by his hometown of Buin, close to the Chilean capital of Santiago. The Chile captain is one of the stars of Jorge Sampaoli’s side, a keeper who possesses sharp reflexes, astute positional sense, a cool head and a gift for leadership. Sound in the air and on the deck, Bravo inherited the skipper’s armband from the great Marcelo Salas in 2008, having been elected to the post, just as his predecessor was, by his team-mates.  After failing to make much of an impression as a forward and then a defender, Bravo decided to try his luck between the posts. He joined Colo Colo at the age of 11 and eventually triumphed there after almost giving up the game due to a lack of stature. No sooner had he won the 2006 Apertura with  than he joined Real Sociedad, where he has also become an idol and has racked up the second-highest number of appearances by a foreigner at the club. After helping the San Sebastian side win the Spanish second division title in 2010, Bravo then played his part as they reached the UEFA Champions League for the first time in 2013. Though the custodian enjoyed little luck at the South American U-20 Championships in Uruguay in 2003, he made his full international debut under Nelson Acosta only a year and a half later at the Copa America in Peru. By the end of the qualifiers for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany™, he had become  first-choice keeper.  Nicknamed (Little Monkey) in recognition of his agility, Bravo retained the gloves for the successful South Africa 2010 qualifying campaign and with 78 caps to his name, he has former striker Leonel Sanchez’s record of 85 appearances for Chile in his sights, a record he could pass at the world finals.

The goalkeeper was urged to take up football by his older brother Thierno, who played in France for Olympique Marseille and internationally for Guinea.  The younger Barry went for trials with Stella Abidjan, but failed to make the grade as a midfielder. He then urged the coaches at the ASEC Mimosas academy to give him a try and it was there that his qualities as a keeper were recognized. He signed his first professional contract with Mimosas in 1999, and went to French club Stade Rennes a year later after the French club noticed him during a youth tour.  At Rennes he failed to usurp international goalkeepers Bernard Lama and Petr Cech and he joined Beveren in 2003, first on loan and then on a permanent move. He stayed with the club until 2007, before moving to Lokeren, where he has since been their first choice goalkeeper. He has twice won the Belgian Cup with Lokeren and has been voted as the best goalkeeper in the country. The 34-year-old first played for the Elephants in 2000 and, since establishing himself as the first choice goalkeeper, has been virtual ever-present. His international highlight came at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations, where he did not concede a goal in open play at the 2012 edition as Côte d’Ivoire lost on penalties in the final against Zambia.  After playing once in the preliminaries for the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cup™ finals, Barry has missed just one qualifier since then.

He moved to the San Pedro-based side in 2009 and three years later established himself as No1, earning the respect of the club's loyal fans with a string of impressive performances across competitions.

Although it seems unlikely that he will get much playing-time at the finals, Mande will gain some valuable experience and could well use his time in Brazil with the Elephants to stake his place to be in contention to take over from Boubacar Barry. He already stood in for the Ivorian goalkeeping legend in the 2-2 draw against Belgium in March. Stabaek is extremely proud of Mande\\'s call-up for the Elephants, with goalkeeper coach Espen Granli saying that it is the first time a player from the club has made it to the World Cup. \"This is great for the club. Mande has worked extremely hard, determined and has performed consistently at a high level this season. His call-up is very deserving.\""

        "Loic FEUDJOU": "Loic Feudjou was first called up to the Indomitable Lions in early 2012, when he had played little more than a handful of games in his country\\'s top flight. At that stage he had already tasted international football as he made Cameroon\\'s Olympic squad when he was still on the books of third division club Botafogo in 2011. He then joined Coton Sport and has been with the flagship of Cameroonian football since then, winning the league in 2013. Last year he played an important role as Coton Sport reached the semi-finals of the CAF Champions League. Since first being called up for national duty, Feudjou, who is considered a great shot stopper with super reflexes, has been a regular in the squad. He was called up for several 2014 FIFA World Cup™ qualifiers, but he has failed to get past first Idriss Kameni and now Charles Itandje. Coton Sport coach Didier Gomez Da Rosa said Feudjou deserves to have been called up. \"He is simply the best goalkeeper in the national championship, the only one of international stature. He has the potential to be successful. I am convinced he has all the skills required to play in Europe,\" said the coach, who himself was a goalkeeper. Earlier this year Feudjou was watched by scouts of English club Reading and it could well be that he makes a move to Europe after the finals in Brazil."

        "Charles ITANDJE": "Born in France, Charles Itandje has taken over the role of Cameroon's first-choice goalkeeper from Carlos Kameni. Itandje played at youth level for France, and he was included in the extended list of players for before the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany™. He never got to play for the French, though, and thereafter declared his interest to play for Cameroon. He was cleared to play for the Indomitable Lions in 2010 and the 31-year-old featured prominently for the west Africans as they secured a second-consecutive appearance on football's greatest stage, taking over the number one position after the country's first two qualifiers and then keeping it for the remaining six matches. Itandje first played for Paris-based Red Star before making his name at Lens, where he enjoyed seven successful seasons, playing in well over 150 matches for the club. He moved to Premier League side Liverpool in August 2007 as understudy to Pepe Reina and played a few cup games for the Reds, but his career with the club never really took off. He went on loan to Greek club Kavala before being released from his contract with Liverpool to join Atromitos. Last year he was transferred to Greek giants PAOK and was loaned to Turkish Super Lig club Konyasport, for whom he performed well. "

        "Sammy NDJOCK": "Sammy N'Djock is one of a growing number of African players plying their trade in Turkey. After coming through the youth ranks at French club Lille, whom he joined as a teenager, the goalkeeper was hoping to break through into the senior side. When that did not happen, he moved to Turkish club Antalyaspor in 2010. He was loaned out to newly promoted Fethiyespor at the beginning of the 2013/14 season and received regular playing time with the club based in Fethiye. The 24-year-old was in goal when the club, playing in its first-ever season in the top flight, recorded arguably their best-ever result, knocking Turkish giants Fenerbahce out of the cup with a 2-1 victory in Istanbul. N'Djock, whose main strengths in goal are his rapid reflexes and strong positional sense, was called up regularly as the Indomitable Lions secured a second consecutive appearance at the FIFA World Cup™, but he failed to get on the pitch. It would come as a major surprise if he gets off the bench in Brazil, but with time on his side and experienced still to be gained, he could well become his country's number one goalkeeper in the future.

        "David OSPINA": "Regardless of the attacking firepower in the Colombia team, one of their biggest stars is undisputedly the No1 David Ospina. The only Colombian not to miss a single minute of qualifying ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™, he is considered indispensable by coach Jose Pekerman.   Ospina is a mature, highly-competent goalkeeper who stands out for his ability to marshal the rearguard. It is no coincidence that his country ended the South-American preliminaries with the best defensive record, conceding only 13 times in 16 games.   He received his footballing education at the academy of former pro Alexis Garcia and first played between the sticks by chance. The then-striker only tried his hand at goalkeeping when filling in for his youth team’s regular keeper. From there he joined the Atletico Nacional youth set-up and would become the youngest ever league champion in Colombian football history at 18. It came as little surprise, therefore, to see him seize the chance to play in Europe, where he has been first-choice custodian with Nice since 2008.   A regular on the international scene since his days as a youth player, Ospina was part of the  squad which competed at the FIFA U-20 World Cup 2005 at just 17, although he did not feature. His debut with the senior side would arrive just one year later against Uruguay due to the sending-off of the late Miguel Calero. After that, he became a squad regular before eventually making the No1 jersey his own in 2009 and featuring in six qualifying matches ahead of South Africa 2010.   Given Colombia’s failure to qualify for South Africa and an inopportune injury that ruled him out of the Copa America 2011, Brazil 2014 will be the 25-year-old’s first major tournament at senior level.

        "Camilo VARGAS": "Though goalkeeping is his trade, one of Camilo Vargas’ most memorable performances came when he scored the winning goal for Santa Fe in a 2011 instalment of their rivalry with Millonarios, the oldest derby in Colombian football. Aside from his goalscoring abilities, the 25-year-old custodian possesses lightning reflexes, is as agile as they come and is something of an expert at saving penalties. \\r\\nVargas’ brothers tried their luck as keepers but were unable to break into professional football. After starting out with Maracaneiros, he showed them how it was done, moving to Bogota side Santa Fe at the age of 16 and making his first division debut there in 2007. An idol at the club, he went on to win a Colombian league, Cup and Super Cup with them.\\r\\nA youth international with Colombia, Vargas has still to make his full international debut, though he has been an ever-present in Jose Pekerman squads since September 2012 and a lucky charm to boot – in the 11 Brazil 2014 World Cup qualifiers  played after the keeper’s first call-up they lost just one. \\r\\nAlthough Vargas goes to Brazil 2014 as Pekerman’s third-choice behind David Ospina and the veteran Faryd Mondragon, the world finals will represent a valuable experience for a keeper whose stock is rising all the time and who has a big future ahead of him.

        "Faryd MONDRAGON": "Faryd Mondragon was Colombia’s first-choice goalkeeper during the 1998 FIFA World Cup France™, their most recent appearance on the global stage. The 42-year-old has the distinction of being only the second Colombian after Carlos Valderrama to have taken part in five different World Cup qualifying campaigns, albeit as a non playing member for three of those.   Mondragon first experienced FIFA’s flagship tournament as understudy to Oscar Cordoba at USA 1994 and has been part of the squad for each subsequent qualifying campaign except that of South Africa 2010. And while he did not accrue any playing time on the road to Brazil, his imposing physique and personality mean he continues to be as commanding in the box as ever.   Mondragon brings vast experience to the current  squad, something coach Jose Pekerman values highly, not least because (The Turk) is the only squad member to have previously competed at a World Cup.   The keeper’s 24-year professional career has taken him to various corners of the globe, with spells at Independiente in Argentina, Galatasaray in Turkey and FC Koln in Germany, among others. If there is one team that defines him, however, it is Deportivo Cali – the club where he made his debut at 19 and where he is again a key player today.  For the evergreen shot-stopper, a third World Cup would be a fitting end to a long and successful career. "

        "Keylor NAVAS": "With more than 50 caps to his name, Keylor Navas has asserted himself as Costa Rica’s first-choice goalkeeper since 2008. In 2005, Costa Rican heavyweights Saprissa signed the youngster to his first professional contract. It took Navas a few seasons to break into the first team, but from 2008 to 2010 he earned the starting role for Saprissa and was influential in his side’s triumphant 2008/09 Apertura season. During his time at Saprissa, Navas earned his first cap with  in 2008, and he was named the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup’s best goalkeeper as Costa Rica reached the semi-finals, who were only beaten on penalties by Mexico. Shortly thereafter, then-Spanish second division side Albacete snatched Navas up in 2010. Levante came calling a year later and after a spell on loan with the La Liga side, Navas’ move was made permanent. After serving as Gustavo Munua’s backup for two seasons, Navas is now Levante’s top choice in net. With a starting role secured at the club level and a successful FIFA World Cup™ qualifying campaign under his belt, Keylor Navas looks poised to offer his safe hands to Jorge Luis Pinto’s side in Brazil.

    {
        "Patrick PEMBERTON": "In the national team picture since 2010, Patrick Pemberton has not been able to establish himself as a consistent presence in goal for Costa Rica, but nevertheless he has served admirably for  on many occasions. En route to Costa Rica’s successful qualification, Pemberton filled in for Keylor Navas during two CONCACAF ‘Hexagonal’ matches, earning two vital draws for Costa Rica along the way. Pemberton put together a spectacular season between the posts for Alajuelense in 2013, which undoubtedly caught the eye of Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto, and he has seen continued success with Alajuelense’s progression in the CONCACAF Champions League. In addition to his two Hexagonal appearances, Pemberton also filled in for Costa Rica’s quarter-final 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup run, surrendering only two goals in four matches. Additionally, Pemberton was named the best goalkeeper at the 2013 UNCAF Copa Centroamericana that saw Costa Rica claim the regional championship for a record seventh time. While Navas looks prepared to take the starting role for  at Brazil 2014, Pinto will be comforted knowing there is no lack of depth or experience in his side’s last line of defence. "

        "Daniel CAMBRONERO": "Inexperienced at international level, Daniel Cambronero is expected to be Jorge Luis Pinto’s third-choice goalkeeper at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™. Cambronero made his way through the youth ranks at Saprissa before making his professional debut with Puntarenas in 2007. The 28-year-old then had a two-year stint at Universidad de Costa Rica before making a move to Herediano in 2011 where he is currently enjoying a fine run of form, helping the club secure second place finish in the 2013 Primera Division Apertura season behind Saprissa. A veteran of the FIFA U-17 World Cup Finland 2003, where he helped lead  to an impressive quarter-final finish, Cambronero has been given only a handful of caps for Costa Rica’s senior national team and has been largely out of the  set-up since 2011. Cambronero has been a part of several national team camps, however, and he was part of the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup squad, though he did not see the field during the competition. With Keylor Navas in outstanding form for both club and country of late, Cambronero will likely go unused at Brazil 2014 but the experience he can gain under the tutelage of both Navas and back-up goalkeeper Patrick Pemberton will be invaluable as he continues to fine-tune his trade at Herediano.

        "Stipe PLETIKOSA": "Goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa has been a regular part of the Croatian national team for 15 years and his consistency lends stability to the  defence. The 35-year-old has more than 100 caps to his name, including appearances at UEFA EURO 2008 and 2012 as well as the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups™, and has appeared for the national side at every level from U-15 upwards. Croatia’s first-choice goalkeeper at Korea/Japan 2002 at the age of 23, he remains in the role to this day. Pletikosa celebrated a special milestone on 6 February 2013, when he won his 100th cap together with team-mates Darijo Srna and Josip Simunic in an international match against Korea Republic. The 2002 Croatian Player of the Year spent his youth and the early part of his senior career at Hajduk Split before moving to Shakhtar Donetsk and later to Spartak Moscow. Pletikosa has amassed six titles in his homeland and Ukraine in a career spanning almost 20 years. The “Octopus”, as he is affectionately known by many fans, has also suffered several setbacks over the years. He suffered a serious muscle injury shortly before UEFA EURO 2004, resigning him to the role of a spectator at Europe’s biggest tournament. At club level, he also endured a disappointing loan spell at Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur during the 2010/11 season, managing just one appearance for Spurs before moving to top-flight Russian club FK Rostov the following season. Apart from Mario Mandzukic, Pletikosa was the only Croatian player to feature in all 12 of his team’s qualifying matches (including play-offs) for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Thanks to his exceptional physical fitness, though he will be Croatia’s oldest player at this summer’s competition, it is highly unlikely to be the 35-year-old's final appearance at a major international tournament.

        "Oliver ZELENIKA": "Oliver Zelenika making an appearance in Brazil would be one of the biggest surprises of this summer. The 21-year-old will travel as the third-choice goalkeeper for Croatia, having not yet tasted senior international football. Regular keeper Stipe Pletikosa, aged 35, is coach Niko Kovac’s undisputed No1, while 29-year-old Danijel Subasic will act as his back-up. Nevertheless, Zelenika, a surprise inclusion ahead of Lovre Kalinic, previously a regular in recent squads, has plenty of time to impress. Zelenika’s development in the last 12 months has undoubtedly helped the rangy custodian to emerge as a viable candidate for a place in the  squad. He made his U-21 debut a year ago under none other than Kovac, who was evidently impressed enough to gamble on the youngster for the upcoming 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™. He joined Dinamo Zagreb at the age of 13 and signed his first professional contract with the club from Croatia’s capital in 2011, spending 2012/13 out on loan at Rudes and part of 2013/14 loaned to Lokomotiva Zagreb.

        "Danijel SUBASIC": "Danijel Subasic’s rise has been over the past two years nothing short of exceptional. Since leaving Hajduk Split in the winter of 2011/12 for then second-division French outfit AS Monaco, the goalkeeper quickly became first-choice No1. On the final day of the same season, Subasic even scored from a free-kick, his only ever goal in a competitive match. After promotion to Ligue 1 in 2013, the club invested over €100m, bringing in world-class players such as Radamel Falcao, Joao Moutinho and James Rodriguez. Monaco were suddenly competing for the title, but Subasic had no problem adapting to the increased expectation levels and fitted right in among his illustrious new colleagues. In the national team he has rarely been afforded an opportunity to shine, though that has more to do with the experience of first-choice custodian Stipe Pletikosa who, with over 100 caps has become something of an institution between the sticks for Croatia, than his own performances. Subasic made his debut in November 2009 and was part of the squad which travelled to UEFA EURO 2012. "

His form was instrumental in earning promotion in 2005, but relegation soon followed and his calming influence at the back again helped the club bounce back up to the top flight in 2008. Banguera was in goal for what was arguably Ecuador's greatest ever achievement in international football, when an U-17 side took gold at the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro. He received his first senior cap against Haiti in 2008 and was an unused member of the squad in qualifying for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa and at the 2011 Copa America.

His assured displays earned him a switch to Deportivo Quito, where he clinched the title in 2011, and he currently plies his trade for another big Quito club, El Nacional. Bone made his senior Ecuador debut in a friendly against Jamaica back in September 2011. He has won three caps in all, the most recent of which came in a 2014 FIFA World Cup™warm-up fixture against Australia in March this year, conceding five goals in total.

        "Mickael LANDREAU": "Having spent the entirety of his career in France, goalkeeper Mickael Landreau set the all-time record for Ligue 1 appearances on 4 December last year. Throughout his years in the game, he has won admiration for his spectacular saves and rapid reflexes, and he has also foiled many a forward from the penalty spot. His talent was evident at a young age, and Landreau made his top-flight debut for Nantes at 17, before tying down a first-team place and being awarded the captain's armband. He also played a central role as  lifted a pair of French Cups in 1999 and 2000 and clinched the league title in 2001.\\r\\nLandreau enjoyed his first international call-ups during his time at Nantes, but with Fabien Barthez and Gregory Coupet ahead of him in the queue, his opportunities were limited. He thus travelled to UEFA EURO 2004 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup™ as France's third-choice custodian, and after the latter tournament he left Nantes for Paris Saint-Germain. Landreau clinched the 2008 French League Cup during his three years in the capital, but even greater successes lay ahead at Lille, where he won a league and cup double in 2011.\\r\\nWearing the gloves for Bastia since 2012, Landreau returned to the France fold under Didier Deschamps after a five-year absence, though he remains third in the pecking order behind Hugo Lloris and Steve Mandanda.

        "Manuel NEUER": "Manuel Neuer’s displays as a youngster made it immediately apparent to observers that he was destined for greatness. He is the perfect example of a modern goalkeeper: while his exceptional reflexes and penalty area domination are enough to set him apart as a top-class all-round custodian, it is Neuer’s unerringly accurate long-distance throws to team-mates that make him truly unique, allowing him to swiftly launch attacks both for his club Bayern Munich and the German national team.\\r\\nThe Gelsenkirchen native’s path into the game started as a five-year-old with Schalke and he made his Bundesliga debut for the club 15 years later, before swiftly making the Royal Blues’ No1 jersey his own. Neuer signed for Bayern in summer 2011 and in subsequent seasons has been a key part of the club’s triumphs in winning a host of domestic honours as well as the UEFA Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup titles.Neuer first made international headlines in 2009 when he lifted the U-21 European Championship crown with Germany. Just a year later he was Joachim Low’s first choice in the senior side at the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ South Africa after previous incumbent Rene Adler pulled out through injury. Neuer took full advantage of the opportunity and has been the country’s undisputed No1 ever since. He was named as Germany’s Player of the Year in 2011 and was voted on to the FIFA/FIFPro World XI two years later. “We can go to the World Cup full of self-belief,” Neuer told in an exclusive interview just a few months ago, determined to help Germany, bronze medallists at the two most recent finals, win the Trophy for a fourth time.

        "Ron-Robert ZIELER": "Ron-Robert Zieler’s sharp reflexes and ability to dominate his penalty area have helped turn him into one of Germany’s best goalkeepers. He is often cited alongside Manuel Neuer as the prototype of a modern custodian, thanks to his ease in possession, his willingness to receive the ball and initiate moves from the back, as well as doubling up as a sweeper to nip opposition attacks in the bud.\\r\\nZieler joined Cologne as a ten-year-old and went on to represent Germany at youth level while at the club. Six years later he moved to Manchester United, where he trained in the reserves, but returned to Germany in summer 2010 after struggling to break through in England. Since then he has made the No1 jersey his own at Bundesliga side Hannover 96.\\r\\nThe shot-stopper was involved in the national set-up in every age category from U-16 through to U-20, with his greatest success so far coming at Germany’s triumphant U-19 European Championship campaign in 2008. Having demonstrated his top-class range of talents at the FIFA U-20 World Cup Egypt 2009, Zieler was handed his senior debut away to Ukraine in November 2011 and was also included in Germany’s UEFA EURO 2012 squad. National team coach Joachim Low clearly has faith in his abilities, with Zieler travelling to Brazil as a highly-dependable back-up. "

One of just a handful of domestic-based Black Stars called up for FIFA World Cup duty, Adams earned his place in the squad for Brazil 2014 with brilliant performances during the CAF African Nations Championship in 2014, in which he conceded just one goal in six matches en route to a second-placed finish.

He has since been linked with a move to greener pastures in South Africa. Adams is capable of pulling off breathtaking saves from close range, amply making up for his smaller frame. It’s precisely this quality that Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah recognised in Adams as he penned the keeper’s name on his squad list for Brazil, four years after the disappointment of being one of the last dropped for South Africa 2010.

Born in Norway, he has been tipped by many to become a goalkeeping great for Ghana, but he played just twice in Brazil 2014 qualifying while spending most of his time on the bench as understudy to Fatawu Dauda. However, the 26-year-old keeper will have done his chances of becoming first-choice no harm by captaining Norwegian club side Stromsgodset to their first league title since 1973 and being named the league’s top goalkeeper for 2013.\\r\\nKwarasey has, at times, been criticised for hesitating to come off his line. He lined up once for Norway as a youth international, but he turned down further opportunities to play for the Scandinavian country and opted instead to hold out hope for a chance with his beloved Black Stars. His first cap came after a long wait in 2011 when he took the pitch for a CAF Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Swaziland. "

He was a bit-part player for the Black Stars until the beginning of 2013, when he suddenly found himself thrust into the top position at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations. He was the most-used goalkeeper in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ qualifiers too, lining up in the all-important 6-1 thrashing of Egypt that all but guaranteed the west Africans their third consecutive appearance at the world finals.\\r\\nThe 29-year-old joined South African club Orlando Pirates at the start of the 2013/14 season, but he had to wait nearly half a year before appearing in his first competitive match for the Buccaneers.

The goalkeeper made his international debut in early 2012 but was not part of the squad that travelled to UEFA EURO 2012. Coach Fernando Santos decided that Karnezis was to be his No1 throughout Brazil 2014 qualifying after he impressed in a friendly against Norway, and the Portuguese coach was rewarded with a series of fine displays. The former Panathinaikos man kept a remarkable eight clean sheets in European Group G as Greece finished second behind free-scoring Bosnia-Herzegovina.  At club level, he appeared once in Panathinaikos’s title-winning campaign of 2009/10, but became a regular in the 2011/12 season, picking up the league’s award for goalkeeper of the year, which he retained a year later. His impressive performances at club and international level were enough to pique the interest of Italian side Udinese, who signed him in 2013 but immediately loaned him out to feeder club Granada in Spain, where he has found first-team opportunities limited.

The PAOK stopper comes into the tournament in solid form, keeping a clean sheet once every three Greek Super League games during the 2013/14 season. Fernando Santos gave Glykos his debut back in March in a friendly against Korea Republic and was impressed enough to include him among his final 23 in Brazil. The stopper began his career at Olympiacos, playing in their youth and reserve teams before signing for PAOK in 2007. He was then shipped out on loan, making a handful of appearances, before establishing himself in the first team fold in the 2011/12 season. From then, he has regularly done battle with the other stoppers in the squad to secure the No1 spot. In fact, at the start of the 2013/14 season, he began the league campaign on the bench, with Spaniard Jacobo preferred, before being handed the first team reins in November.

His full Greece debut came in a whirlwind period for Kapino at the end of 2011, as he made his top-flight bow for Greek giants Panathinaikos in September of that year.

        "Noel VALLADARES": "  Noel Valladares, 37, will captain Honduras at a FIFA World Cup™ for the second time this summer. Despite turning professional with Real Comayagua nearly two decades ago, his reflexes and distribution not only remain intact, but couple perfectly with the experience that he has gained over the years. His main strength is as a shot-stopper and is particularly impressive when defending his goal from close range. Valladares is also very skilled with his feet and has been known to play up front on occasion.   Valladares has spent his entire career in his homeland, where he made his professional debut aged 18. Two years later he took a step up by joining Motagua, one of Honduras’ most traditional teams. He picked up five titles between 1995 and 2000, the year when he made his senior debut for his country against Haiti in a qualifier for the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan. Since then, he has made the No1 jersey his own, appearing 53 times for his country over four different World Cup qualifying campaigns. Moreover, he was a key member of the team that put  back on the world stage at South Africa 2010 after a 28-year absence, before helping secure their qualification for Brazil 2014.   As captain and mainstay of his national team, his contribution will be key to Honduras’ attempts to survive the group stage in Brazil. "

        "Donis ESCOBER": "The generation you belong to can change everything. Just ask Donis Escober. Despite having all the attributes to be a first-choice international goalkeeper, he has long found himself playing second fiddle to Noel Valladares, Honduras's second most capped player of all time. Escober has spent his entire career at Olimpia, one of the biggest clubs in Honduras, having burst onto the scene as a 20-year-old back in 2001. His personal highlight at club level was undoubtedly the 2012 season, when he went 833 minutes without conceding, falling just 35 minutes short of breaking Roger Mayorga's 1976 record for the most time a keeper has gone unbeaten in the Honduran top flight. Though he earned his first senior call-up just a year after rising to prominence, the custodian – who is known for his poise when coming for crosses and his physical strength – has had to settle for being a perennial understudy at international level, making just 20-odd appearances over more than a decade. Be that as it may, if there is one thing Honduras can take for granted going into the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™, it's that they have a safe pair of hands on the bench. "

It was with the fast-growing team that he established himself as a promising shot-stopper, including tasting his first league championship during the 2006/07 season.  That feat proved just a prelude to a flow of achievements. After moving to Sepahan in 2008, Ahmadi went on excel in his role between the sticks as his side twice won the domestic title.

A product of the Persepolis youth academy, Haghighi made his debut for the Tehran giants against Saipa at the tender age of 18 in 2006, when he famously saved a penalty by the legendary Ali Daei. When first-choice keepers Misagh Memarzadeh and Mehdi Vaezi were sidelined due to injuries in 2008/09, he jumped at the chance and made the number one jersey his own. He became Persepolis' youngest ever captain during the 2010/11 season, skippering his side to a 2-1 defeat of Saipa. He proved something of a trail-blazer in 2011 when he was signed by Rubin Kazan, making him the first-ever Iranian to play in the Russian Premier League.

Even after his qualifying mission was complete, the Portuguese manager continued his search for foreign-based players eligible to play for Iran. His latest revelation is Daniel Davari, the 26-year-old German-based goalkeeper.  Born in Germany and starting his career with 1. FSV Mainz 05, Davari moved to Eintracht Braunschweig in 2009.

        "Gianluigi BUFFON": "Gianluigi Buffon is a player who needs no introduction, having long been identified as one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of the game – like his Juventus and Italy predecessor Dino Zoff. Since winning the 2006 FIFA World Cup™ and being voted best goalkeeper during that tournament, he has taken over the captain's armband – one of Cesare Prandelli’s first decisions when he became coach in 2010. Imperious on his line and a commanding presence in the box, the 36-year-old has lost none of his edge and has no plans to hang up his gloves just yet.  With his tall, slender frame, Buffon was always destined to be a goalkeeper. Capable of making the most difficult saves look easy, especially from point-blank range, there is no apparent weakness in his game. Perhaps one of his main qualities is an ability to put any rare errors he makes to the back of his mind and focus on the match again. Buffon made his  debut away against Russia on 29 October 1997. The following year, he travelled to the 1998 World Cup in France as Italy's second-choice keeper. He made his mark at Korea/Japan 2002 by saving a penalty in Italy's fateful golden-goal elimination by Korea Republic in the Round of 16.  That disappointment was forgotten at Germany 2006, however, when Buffon won his first major international trophy. The then 28-year-old had a vital part to play in Italy's penalty shoot-out win in the Final against France, keeping out Zinedine Zidane's extra-time header with a superb leaping save and then winning a bout of spot-kick mind games with his  team-mate David Trezeguet, forcing the Frenchman to change his usual penalty-taking technique.

        "Salvatore SIRIGU": "Athletic, quick off his line and adept at dealing with low shots despite his 6'4 frame, Salvatore Sirigu has established himself as the latest understudy to Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. Exemplary between the posts for Paris Saint-Germain, the Sardinian has come a long way since starting out at Palermo, where he was nicknamed  (Little Walter) in reference to former Italy custodian Walter Zenga, the coach who handed him his Serie A debut. Curiously, Sirigu was keen on being a forward in his youth, but as he suffered from mild asthma attacks that prevented him from keeping up with play – and was also equipped with very large hands – his coaches suggested he take up the gloves instead. A natural in the role, Sirigu gained his break as Palermo's third-choice keeper for the 2006/07 campaign, relying on the UEFA Cup for playing time. For two consecutive seasons, he then honed his skills out on loan, first at third-tier Cremonese and next at second-division Ancona, before finally getting a proper chance to shine for Palermo. His progress has been remarkable ever since, even if he missed out on the 2010 FIFA World Cup™, with Marcello Lippi considering him fourth choice.

The youngster certainly has a habit of leaving a good impression, having risen through the age levels for Italy since 2008 and generally turning heads. Strong on his line, confident in the air and precise with his distribution, Perin continues to improve – and made history in 2012 by becoming the first player to be named Serie B\\'s goalkeeper of the year at just 19 years of age. \\r\\nBefore that, he was snapped up by Genoa at the age of 16 and made his Serie A debut at 18 on 22 May 2011, before spending two seasons out on loan.

Currently on the books of Standard Liege in Belgium, Kawashima began his professional career with J.League side Omiya Ardija after finishing high school. Kawashima transferred to Nagoya Grampus in 2004, where he found himself competing for game time with Seigo Narazaki, a keeper who had played at the 2002 World Cup. Unable to dislodge his more experienced team-mate, Kawashima signed for Kawasaki Frontale in 2007. This move brought almost instant success, and Kawashima made his international debut the following year. After a string of sparkling performances at South Africa 2010, his services were procured by Belgian club Lierse.  Known as a vocal and uncompromising keeper, Kawashima has modelled his playing style on Italian legend Gianluigi Buffon, whom he closely watched during a short stay in Italy early in his career.  Kawashima came of age at South Africa 2010, not least for the way in which he marshalled his defence. In the Round-of-16 game against Paraguay, he kept the South Americans at bay for 120 minutes but was unable to prevent his side losing on penalties. Since then, the 31-year-old has proven to be a remarkable penalty-stopper. At the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, for example, Kawashima saved two spot-kicks against Korea Republic in the semi-final shoot-out.

Nishikawa’s spot at Hiroshima was filled by Takuto Hayashi, who had been selected for Japan in an international friendly in 2012, albeit without playing.  Nishikawa is the heir apparent of the seemingly immovable Blue Samurai goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima. A product of the Oita Trinita youth academy, Nishikawa was a solid performer in national age-category teams, including at the FIFA U-20 World Cup 2005. He also made his professional debut for Oita that year, and soon became the club’s top goalkeeper.  He was selected for the Japan squad the following year but did not play, and was between the sticks at the 2008 Beijing Olympics for all three of Japan’s group-stage defeats. Nishikawa made his full international debut in 2009, but this delight was tempered by Oita’s demotion that season.  After shifting to Hiroshima in 2010, Nishikawa was considered unlucky not to be included in Japan’s squad to the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™. Since that tournament, he has been a constant back-up to Kawashima and keeps the incumbent on his toes.  Nishikawa enjoyed a banner year in 2012, when he was instrumental in helping Sanfrecce win their maiden J.League crown and was chosen in the J.League Best XI.

Tokyo born and bred, Gonda came through the FC Tokyo youth programme and joined the senior team in 2007. Although Tokyo were relegated to the second division in 2010, they rebounded the following season, with Gonda taking on an increasingly important leadership role in the process. \\r\\nGonda regularly represented Japan at U-20 and U-23 levels, and played for the senior national team once in 2010.

The 25-year-old was inspired to become a goalkeeper after watching former USA shot-stopper Tony Meola, as well as modelling himself on legendary Danish custodian Peter Schmeichel. Unafraid to put his body on the line, Gonda’s undoubted potential has been duly noted by Samurai Blue coach Alberto Zaccheroni.

That was the moment he still remembers as the most difficult one so far in his career, but the following year saw Lee concede a crucial 120th-minute winner shortly after he was brought on for a potential shootout in the semi-final against  United Arab Emirates during the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China.\\r\\nHowever, Lee had established himself at Busan by the time he returned to the national team for the 2012 Men’s Olympic Football Tournament in London, where he rose to the occasion by coming on as a second-half substitute to deny Daniel Sturridge’s decisive penalty in the shootout during the quarter-final against Great Britain. Although he could not keep Brazil from scoring three unanswered goals in the semi-finals, Lee came home with his head held high after winning the bronze medal. "

However, Corona has yet to make the Mexican No1 jersey his own and is currently involved in an intriguing tussle for supremacy with Guillermo Ochoa, who is likewise in outstanding form with French club Ajaccio.  For the last few years, several coaches have alternated between the two and even for a brief period they were replaced by Moises Munoz before resuming their perennial fight for a spot, and it is quite likely that coach Herrera will not make a decision until Mexico's first game at Brazil 2014.

However, with Jose de Jesus Corona and Guillermo Ochoa both on excellent runs of form, the Toluca goalkeeper has had very few opportunities to show what he can do at this level. One did eventually arise, however. As Ochoa was suspended for having accidentally ingested clenbuterol and Corona had been dropped from the squad for disciplinary issues, Talavera was handed the jersey in the run-up to the CONCACAF Gold Cup 2011, and he went on to perform well in the Mexicans’ victory over rivals USA in the continental final. But when his absent compatriots were brought back into the fold, he returned to his previous role of third-choice custodian, safe in the knowledge that he was capable of stepping in whenever necessary.

However, his experiences with the national team have been bittersweet at times. Third-choice goalkeeper at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany™, he looked set to be given the nod at South Africa 2010 but, to the surprise of many, Mexico coach Javier Aguirre placed his confidence in veteran Oscar Perez instead. The situation did not change for Ochoa during the Brazil 2014 qualifiers. Ochoa alternated between time between the posts and time on the bench, and he was even sidelined from the team for a short period of time by then coach Jose Manuel de la Torre. However, Ochoa was up to the task in the games in which he saw action and such good performances, coupled with his excellent stint with the French side Ajaccio, making him a candidate for earning a starting spot for  in Brazil. It is as yet unclear which keeper will start Mexico's opening match at Brazil 2014, but there is no doubt that, if Ochoa is selected, the nation will be in safe hands. "

It seems equally likely, however, that Cillesen’s fame and international status will continue to rise in the years to come. The evidence of the 2013/14 season, in which 25-year-old became Ajax’s No1 goalkeeper and shone in the Amsterdam giants’ title charge, would certainly suggest as much. Cillesen’s fine form was one of the key factors in Frank de Boer’s side achieving the best defensive record in the Netherlands, and helped justify the faith shown in him by the club three years earlier. That was when Ajax paid €3 million to prise the then 22-year-old from NEC, the club with which he first made his name. Cillesen had already forced his way into the Netherlands U-21 side by that time, and senior recognition has since followed, with Louis van Gaal handing him his debut in June 2013.  Van Gaal’s faith in the young keeper was displayed more recently when he was named in the starting line-up to face France in March, and this rising star is sure to provide genuine competition for his more experienced rivals.

At 30, the Swansea City keeper is the most experienced of the contenders to claim Maarten Stekelenburg’s No1 shirt, but even he has won only 14 caps to date.  The first of those came in 2008, during Vorm’s time with Utrecht, and he has played infrequently for the national team in the years since. His first run as first-choice arrived last September and October with a sequence of three consecutive World Cup qualifiers under Louis van Gaal, raising hopes that he would be the man between the sticks in Brazil.  Experimentation with candidates for the position has since followed, though, and Vorm has contended himself with continuing the fine form that has made him a firm favourite of Swansea’s supporters. His expertise in stopping penalties is particularly renowned in England, with the keeper himself attributing his fine record in such situations to analysing the technique of future opponents. Now he will hope for the chance to show his reflexes and nerves of steel in Brazil as the Dutch aim to emulate their impressive 2010 campaign. "

Though still just 26, he has earned his place as the undisputed No1 at Newcastle United, the club he joined from ADO Den Haag in the summer of 2005. It took loan spells with Carlisle United and Scottish side Falkirk to help gain Krul the necessary experience to force his way into the Magpies’ starting line-up, but since earning his first opportunity in 2010 there has been no shifting him. Indeed, while Newcastle have endured a largely forgettable 2013/14 campaign, Krul has remained impressive, even winning the Premier League player of the month award for November – the only goalkeeper this season to have picked up such an honour.  At international level, he has progressed through the ranks, starring at U-17 and U-21 level before making his senior debut against Brazil in 2011. More caps have since followed, including an appearance against Turkey during the Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign. Nonetheless, Krul has recently fallen out of favour with Louis van Gaal and will be desperate to regain his place ahead of the FIFA World Cup™. "

An expert shot-stopper with great acrobatic ability, Enyeama has occasionally been hurt by lapses in concentration, but is capable of pulling off spectacular saves, as he proved at the 2010 FIFA World Cup™, when he won two Man of the Match awards in Nigeria’s three matches. Indeed, his performances in defeats against Argentina and Greece in South Africa were arguably among the best in the recent history of the World Cup. \\r\\n A popular figure in the country and the team, 'The Cat' has been the consistent first choice for over a decade, playing in 28 out of 30 World Cup qualifiers that the Super Eagles have contested since 2006. Enyeama’s record in the CAF Africa Cup of Nations is equally impressive, having helped the Super Eagles to third-place finishes in the 2004, 2006 and 2010 tournaments and to their third continental trophy in 2013. \\r\\n In the AFCON in South Africa last year, he served as captain in the absence of Joseph Yobo, and was named goalkeeper of the tournament. He has a reputation for being particularly strong against penalties, and has even been known to convert a few himself.  \\r\\nEnyeama has earned a good amount of high-level club experience as well. He won the CAF Champions League twice with Nigerian club Enyimba before moving to Israel in 2005, where he played in the UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League. Having attracted attention from a number of clubs, Enyeama signed for French champions Lille in 2011 but went back to Israel on loan.

That was during the 2008 Cup of Nations campaign, when the then Nigeria coach Berti Vogts preferred him to Enyeama, saying he wanted Ejide's height and strength. Last year he was an unused sub when Nigeria won their third continental title at the Cup of Nations in South Africa, and likewise at the FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil. \\r\\n Ejide started his professional career with Gabros International in Nigeria before being signed by Etoile Sportive du Sahel. He twice played in CAF Champions League final with the Tunisian club but ended up on the losing side both times. After four years in North Africa, he moved to Europe, where he signed for French club Bastia. After struggling to make the first team, he joined Hapoel Petach Tikva in Israel, spending several successful seasons with the club. He then moved within the Israeli league to Hapoel Be'er Sheva when his former club was relegated, and this year helped the club to qualify for the Europa League by finishing second. "

His favoured role with the ‘Big Boss’ has won him a handful of international caps since debuting in January of 2012 against Angola.  \\r\\nAgbim was in Nigeria's squad for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, as well as the FIFA Confederations Cup. Like Nigeria's other reserve goalkeeper, Austin Ejide, he has though found it impossible to get past Vincent Enyeama and has yet to play for the Super Eagles in a FIFA World Cup™ qualifier or Africa Cup of Nations match. \\r\\n Agbim was released by Enugu Rangers earlier in the year after the club found his many absences while on international duty to be too disruptive.

        "EDUARDO": "If there is one image from the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™ that Portuguese fans will never forget, it is of goalkeeper Eduardo sitting on the pitch with tears running down his cheeks. Despite his valiant attempts to keep the team in the tournament, Portugal had just lost to the eventual champions Spain in the Round of 16. Before that Eduardo had gone three games in the group stage without conceding a goal and then kept a clean sheet for 63 minutes of the clash with his country’s great rivals from the Iberian Peninsula. Finally though, David Villa found a way past him, destroying Portuguese dreams and bringing to an end the keeper’s reign as his country’s number one. Eduardo is the perfect example of how the life of a footballer can change almost overnight. After making the Braga No1 shirt his own at the beginning of the 2008/09 season, his terrific performances in the Primeira Liga and the UEFA Cup established him as an athlete with a knack for taking advantage of opportunities when they came his way. \\r\\nHe made his debut for the national team during the qualifying campaign for the 2010 World Cup, and was instrumental as Portugal booked their place in South Africa, before going on to shine at the tournament itself. But in 2011/12 his club Genoa loaned him to Benfica for a year. He hardly played a game for the Lisbon team, and subsequently lost his position in the national side. He then spent a year at Istanbul BB before returning to Braga, and remains a more than capable reserve for the national team "

        "Rui PATRICIO": "First impressions last, as they say. On the pitch, they can play an important part in defining a player’s future by revealing talent and highlighting weaknesses. Sporting fans have been forming their impressions of Rui Patricio since he made his first team debut in the Primeira Liga aged just 18, when the team’s other goalkeepers were ruled out through suspension and injury. And what a debut it was. The keeper was instrumental in an away victory over Maritimo, even saving a penalty to secure a 1-0 win. The following summer he played for Portugal at the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, where the team reached the quarter-finals. And ever since the 2007/08 season Rui Patricio has been Sporting’sfirst choice goalkeeper. Through good times and bad he has been a consistent presence between the posts, identifying and correcting his own mistakes and developing as a player in the best way possible: by playing. It hasn’t all been plain sailing, however. Although he was part of Luiz Felipe Scolari’s squad at UEFA EURO 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, he didn’t get on the pitch. And he was then left out of the squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup™. \\r\\nBut things soon started to look up. When he took over as coach of Portugal during the qualifying campaign for UEFA EURO 2012, Paulo Bento had no qualms about making Patricio his first choice goalkeeper. After all, the coach had been responsible for giving him his Sporting debut all those years ago. And the 'keeper's response could not have been better. He was brilliant at the European Championship, where Portugal reached the semi-finals, and remained first choice for the qualifying campaign for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. At the relatively young age of 26, with eight seasons playing at the highest level for Sporting behind him, Rui Patricio has the experience and talent needed to shine in Brazil. "

Despite coming through Sporting's youth system, the goalkeeper never played for the first team. His displays for the club’s B team, however, led to a move to Leixoes in 2006/07, where he played a key role as the club from Matosinhos won promotion. In the following two seasons Beto was able to display his talents at the highest level, becoming an automatic first choice for Leixoes. He also revealed a knack for saving spot kicks, and was the hero when Leixoes eliminated Benfica from the Taca de Portugal on penalties. In 2008/09 he made a big step, signing for the then Portuguese champions Porto. He faced stiff competition for the number one jersey at his new club, in the shape of Brazilian international Helton. But he certainly took advantage of his opportunities, which were generally limited to games in the Taca de Portugal. His incredible performance against Belenenses, when he saved five spot kicks in the penalty shoot-out, was particularly memorable. \\r\\nHe eventually left Porto to play in Romania, then returned to Portugal with Braga before moving to Sevilla, where he has enjoyed two successful seasons.

        "Igor AKINFEEV": "In a country which has produced such luminaries of the custodian’s art as Lev Yashin and Rinat Dassayev, pulling on the national-team’s No1 jersey has proved an overwhelming burden for many contenders. Yet despite first being handed this responsibility aged just 18, Igor Akinfeev has handled the pressure in exemplary fashion – taking the step in his stride and showing himself a worthy successor to Russia’s former goalkeeping greats.  Even as a youngster, Akinfeev was already tipped by many as a future senior national-team keeper and wasted little time in making that prediction a reality. By 15 he was in Russia’s U-21 squad and made his full international debut in April 2004, starting a friendly versus Norway only 20 days after turning 18. It was a starting berth that, with the exception of spells sidelined through injury, he has clung onto for the ten years since. Akinkeev’s rise was similarly meteoric in his beloved CSKA Moscow, a club he has been a part of from the age of four. First in first-team action at 16 back in 2003, his years of loyal service have been generously replete with silverware – including four Russian titles, six domestic cups and the 2005 UEFA Cup – as well as individual honours aplenty, such as being voted Russia’s goalkeeper of the year on successive occasions. At international level, Akinfeev spent his first major tournament, UEFA EURO 2004, on the bench, though was a key figure in the eastern Europeans’ charge to the continental semi-finals four years later. Again on the bench at EURO 2012, having only recently recovered from major knee surgery, he was back as Russia’s rock-solid last line of defence during their successful qualifying campaign for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™.  \\r\\nNow 28, Akinfeev seems both well-aware of and at ease with his status as a national-team icon. And prior to being a World Cup Ambassador at Russia 2018, Brazil 2014 should provide the vastly experienced keeper with his first taste of life at a World Cup – a stage Yashin and Dassayev graced in such style. \\r\\n"

Boasting dual nationality, the custodian was born near Moscow yet lived in Greece – his mother’s homeland – until the age of 23. The decision about national team representation came to a head in August 2013, when he turned down a call-up from Greece coach Fernando Santos with a view to competing for Russia.  Nor was it long since the keeper’s career had undergone a remarkably rapid turnaround. Having come through a difficult start in the Greek third tier, Lodygin’s top-flight breakthrough season was 2012/13 at modest outfit Skoda Xanthi. From there he was snapped up by big-spending Zenit St. Petersburg, where he wasted little time in wresting a starting spot from fans’ favourite Vyacheslav Malafeev, while underlining his huge potential in the club’s run to the UEFA Champions League Round of 16.  \\r\\nHis decision to return to the country of his birth has proven very wise, with Capello calling him up for the first time in October 2013. And though he made no appearances in the successful Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign, the consistently rave reviews he receives for his displays suggest Igor Akinfeev may need to look over his shoulder sooner rather than later – a situation Capello would surely relish. \\r\\n"

Born in Belgorod, Ryzhikov made his professional debut with his local club at the age of 19, though it was not until he joined to Anzhi Makhachkala in 2005 that he began to make a name for himself in the Russian Premier League. A transfer to Lokomotiv Moscow followed the very next season, though he failed to see much in the way of first-team action in the Russian capital. After a spell on loan with Tom Tomsk, he made the move that would change his career for good, joining Rubin Kazan in 2008 and finally holding down a starting place. The winner of two league titles with his club, Ryzhikov earned an invitation to the national side thanks in no small part to some fine performances in the UEFA Champions League, though his debut cap did not come until March 2011 and a friendly against Qatar.

His age was an important factor in his limited outings with the 27-time Swiss champions, where he was restricted to just 23 appearances in three years.  In 2002 Benaglio moved to Germany with VfB Stuttgart but the then 19-year-old was only third-choice goalkeeper behind Timo Hildebrand and Thomas Ernst. Benaglio was forced to settle for a place in the reserves, who played in the third division at the time. Given the shot-stopper’s burning ambition to succeed, that was not good enough and he was soon on the move again.\\r\\nIn July 2005 Benaglio joined Portuguese islanders CD Nacional Funchal and after some initial teething problems he established himself as the club’s No1. His consistently good performances swiftly attracted the attention of several European sides and in January 2008 German Bundesliga outfit VfL Wolfsburg recruited the Zurich native.  Benaglio’s greatest achievement to date was helping Wolfsburg defy the odds to win their first ever Bundesliga title in 2008/09. \\r\\nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ will be Benaglio’s fifth major international tournament. After making his senior Switzerland debut in a friendly against China PR on 3 June 2006, Benaglio was included in his country’s Germany 2006 squad but was behind Pascal Zuberbuhler and Fabio Coltorti in the pecking order. \\r\\nHowever, at UEFA EURO 2008 Benaglio played in all three group stage games but was unable to prevent the side crashing out of the competition at the first hurdle, a fate that also befell the team at South Africa 2010 and at the Men’s Olympic Football Tournament at London 2012, where Benaglio captained the side.

And while the club has struggled in recent seasons to maintain their English Premier League status, Guzan has been one of their shining stars. \\r\\nThough he has earned relatively few caps, he is expected to become a long-time servant between the posts for the US in the years to come. He played a handful of qualifiers for Klinsmann’s men on the road to Brazil when Howard was down with a rare injury, and the deputy didn’t look out of place on the international stage where he has also represented the US at the Olympic Football Tournament and in the CONCACAF Gold Cup.  \\r\\n“As a goalkeeper, you can’t chase the game or get overexcited. You have to let the game come to you and be ready to make the big save, whether it’s in the first minute or the 90th,” Guzan told , sending a message to coach Jurgen Klinsmann about his readiness.  "

He is adamant that he has learnt from his mistakes, however, and he has certainly seized the opportunity since former club Anderlecht offered him a fresh chance in January 2013.

A product of the  youth system, Rojas made his debut in 2003 and has spent virtually his entire career at the club, with the exception of a brief and unproductive loan spell at Argentinian side Independiente in 2006.

So successful has he been as a right-sided stopper for Chile that his representatives asked the manager at his current club, Cardiff City, where he operates as a midfielder, for him to be utilised in the position he plays for his country. Those pleas fell on deaf ears. Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli has copied what he saw from predecessor Marcelo Bielsa’s side in the build-up to the FIFA World Cup South Africa 2010, when Medel showed the positioning, speed and tremendous tackling ability that make him ideal for a defensive role.

There he was one of the standout stars of a spectacular generation that secured a historical third-placed finish. A less positive side to his game was also on view as he was sent off early on in the semi-final defeat to Argentina.

        "Gonzalo JARA": "Gonzalo Jara is a right-back with good technique, but it’s his versatility that makes him an even more valuable member of Chile’s squad, given that he can also operate on the left, as a centre-back or as a defensive midfielder. A bright future was on the cards for Jara ever since he captained Chile at the 2005 U-20 South American championship in Colombia. That year also saw the full-back further showcase his potential as he played in the U-20 World Cup in Netherlands and was also chosen as the best player at Huachipato, the club where he had arrived just two years earlier as a youth player. 2006 brought a new achievement as Nelson Acosta gave Jara his debut for Chile at just 20 years of age. The following year, he then moved to a big club, Colo-Colo, and went on to win three national titles before establishing himself as a regular under Marcelo Bielsa for Chile in 2009 and securing a transfer to West Bromwich Albion. A starter at the FIFA World Cup South Africa 2010, Jara was suspended for indiscipline in 2011 and subsequently missed ten games. He apologised, however, and returned to play in eight qualifiers en route to Brazil 2014, where he’ll hope to build on his successful season this term with Nottingham Forest.  "

        "Ousmane DIARRASSOUBA": "After first representing Côte d’Ivoire at the 2008 Olympic Football Tournament, where he featured in all four matches the team played before being knocked out at the quarter-final stage by west African rivals Nigeria, Ousmane Viera Diarrassouba had to wait another five years before playing his next competitive game for his country. Although the tall, powerful defender made the squad for all but one of  2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ qualifiers, he featured only once, against Morocco in Côte d’Ivoire's final Group C game. A possible reason why Diarrassouba, after playing at the Olympics, took so long to become established in the senior side is that he was playing his club football in Romania – far from the leagues like France, Belgium and England, from which Côte d’Ivoire coaches traditionally pick their players for international duty. The 27-year-old started had his professional career with local club RC Daloa, before being snapped up by ambitious Romanian side CFR Cluj. Diarrassouba struggled to break into the side though and moved within the Romanian league to FC International on loan. In 2010, he moved to Pandurii Ctargu Jiu and spent three successful seasons with the club. Likewise a move to Turkey saw him become a mainstay for Caykur Rizesporin the Super Lig. "

The 31-year-old was first called up in 2004 and has amassed well over 70 caps since then. Although not big in stature, Boka is known for his pace and hard tackling. Taught the essentials at his hometown club ASEC Abidjan, he was only 16 when he left for Stade Tunisien, whom he represented for three years before joining up with the coterie of Ivorian talent at Beveren. Boka spent two years with the Belgian outfit – often the first port of call in Europe for graduates of the Jean-Marc Guillou academy – and reached the Belgian Cup final in 2004.\\r\\nHe then went on to sign for French side Strasbourg, winning the French League Cup in his first season. Stuttgart stepped in for his services in the summer of 2006 and a year later Boka was celebrating again, having helped the club clinch the Bundesliga title. He now has over 150 Bundesliga appearances to his name. "

A veteran of his country's two previous FIFA World Cup™ finals campaigns, the older of the Toure brothers first broke into the national team in 2000, which allowed him to obtain a work permit when Arsene Wenger wanted to sign him for Arsenal.  At the time Toure was playing for ASEC Mimosas, with whom he had won the CAF Champions League in 1998. He came agonizingly close to adding the UEFA Champions League in 2006, but a 10-man Arsenal side were beaten 2-1 by Barcelona. He is one of several players to have embarked on a successful professional career after going through Jean-Marc Guillou's ASEC Abidjan academy, which he joined as a midfielder. When he emerged after his basic training, he was an athletic, physical, powerful player at right back or in the centre of defence.  A 14-year veteran of the national team, Toure and his world-class brother Yaya form part of an impressive spine of players for, with whom he finished runner-up at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations in 2006 and 2012.

He has also played in 28 qualifying matches, competed in six CAF Africa Cup of Nations and played club football in five European countries, including Spain and England. But had it not been for Gervinho's missed penalty in the 2012 AFCON tournament, Zokora would probably not be in Brazil.  The 33-year-old said at the time that should the west Africans beat Zambia in the final, he would retire from international football. The record shows, however, that Zambia won 8-7 on penalties and even though Zokora retired briefly from international football, he returned just as fast. Zokora is a product of the famous ASEC Mimosas academy, though in part he remembers it tragically as his younger brother Armand drowned whilst celebrating their acceptance to the academy. In memory of his brother, Didier has Armand's name tattooed on his arm.  Currently playing in Turkey with Trabzonspor after stints in Belgium (Racing Genk), France (Saint-Etienne), England (Tottenham Hotspur) and Spain (Sevilla), Zokora says that every game he plays is in memory of his brother. Brazil 2014 will probably offer him the last opportunity to  honour him on the global stage. "

But while Jean-Daniel has managed to play in Ligue 1 with Toulouse and to be called up for international duty by the country of his parents, his brothers Jean-Louis and Jean-Jacques have not managed to reach those heights. Jean-Louis was called up by the French U-18 side whilst on the books of Toulouse, but had to withdraw injured and has played mainly in the lower tiers of English football, while Jean-Jacques has not played above the third tier of French football. The youngest of the brothers, Jean-Daniel broke into the Toulouse first side as an 18-year-old in 2011 and has been playing regularly ever since. In 2013, he received his first call-up into the Elephants squad and, although he has yet to play a competitive match for the side, he was in the squad for four of the eight FIFA World Cup™ qualifiers Côte d’Ivoire played en route to Brazil.

Born in Ouragahio, Aurier moved to France at an early age and came through the youth ranks of Lens, for whom he played his first professional game in 2009, having just turned 17. He stayed with the club until January 2012, when he signed for Toulouse and immediately established himself in the side. He is a versatile player, who feels equally at home playing defensive midfield, in central defence or at right-back. He has a keen eye for goal and in the 2013/14 season, he not only created goals but was one of his club\\'s top scorers. However, being a team player, Aurier is quick to point out that individual statistics mean very little in football. \"I\\'ve got good stats at the moment, but my individual performances aren\\'t the most important thing right now. What is important is the team,” he said. Aurier has established himself as a valuable option for the Elephants after playing his first game for the side in June 2013.

The 27-year-old can play out wide as a conventional attacking winger, but has usually featured at left-back for his current club Eintracht Frankfurt. Djakpa learned the basics in the youth section at Stella Club in his home town of Abidjan. The agile left-footed player graduated to the senior squad and eventually opted to try his hand in Europe. He joined Sogndal in the Norwegian second division in 2006, before signing for Romanian top-flight outfit Pandurii Targu Jiu a year later. Bayer Leverkusen came calling for the Ivorian in 2008, but after his first season the Rhineland side loaned Djakpa to Hannover. The player finally made the breakthrough in the Bundesliga with the Lower Saxony club, and has been more or less a regular since switching to Frankfurt in 2011. He appeared in Côte d’Ivoire colours at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations 2008 in Ghana.

Since then, Bamba has again featured regularly, and in 2012, Bamba and Toure combined as Côte d’Ivoire did not concede a single goal in open play at Africa Cup of Nations, only to be beaten on penalties by Zambia in the final. Bamba plays his club football in Turkey for Trabzonspor, having joined the club from English Championship side Leicester City.

Born in Arras, France, but eligible for Cameroon via his father, Assou-Ekotto first joined up with the Indomitable Lions in February 2009 after heeding the call of then boss Otto Pfister. He was called up for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™ and played in all three matches as the Indomitable Lions crashed out in the first round with three defeats.

Born in Yaounde, N’Koulou learned his trade with the highly regarded Kadji Sport Academy before beginning his rapid ascent to prominence with Monaco. The teenager did not spend long in the Ligue 1 club’s youth teams, impressing in a couple of first-team friendlies en route to making his league debut at the age of 18 in September 2008. Over the course of that season he became an integral part of the side, thanks in no small part to his ability to slot in as both a holding midfielder and a central defender. After several outings for Cameroon’s U-21 side, N’Koulou earned selection for the Men’s Olympic Football Tournament Beijing 2008, the stepping stone to a place in the full national squad, where the then-coach Paul Le Guen used him primarily as a centre-half. He was a regular in the Indomitable Lions side the CAF Africa Cup of Nations in 2010 and, although only 20, he played in all three matches at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™.\\r\\nHis upward mobility with his clubs has been similarly speedy. After his league debut at Monaco, he soon featured regularly for the side and not surprisingly, it did not take long before bigger clubs came calling. The 24-year-old joined Marseille in 2011, and although he has been linked with more moves to Europe's biggest leagues, he has stayed at the Velodrome and gained UEFA Champions League experience. A good showing in Brazil, in what some have called Africa's best defence, would keep the youngster's stock moving even higher. "

That pushed me to work harder.\" Like the other local-based player in the squad, goalkeeper Loic Feudjou, Djeugoue benefited from Coton Sports\\' impressive form in continental competitions. The defender scored a late equalizer against Angolan club Petro Atletico to take his side into the group phase of the CAF Confederations Cup. After being included in the initial squad, he admitted that he knew it would be difficult to make the final 23. \"All players will fight for their place. I just wanted to give my best so that I stood a chance.\" He was given his first chance against Macedonia as a second-half substitute and then started in the Indomitable Lions\\' 2-2 draw against Germany in the last friendly the team played before Finke announced the squad.

After spending two seasons in the lower leagues with Pau, he signed for Toulouse before moving to Turkey, where he joined Gaziantepspor on a three-year contract.

He joined the club at the start of the 2013/14 season, and he soon established himself as a regular with the club as they won a spot in European football again next term. Bedimo was called up by the then-coach Paul Le Guen for the CAF Africa Cup of Nations 2010 as the only left-back in the squad but he failed to make the trip to South Africa for the FIFA World Cup™.

        "Aurelien CHEDJOU": "Defender Aurelien Chedjou’s rise to prominence has come on the back of his displays at Ligue 1 outfit Lille, with whom he won the French title in 2011. Able to line up in central defence or as a defensive midfielder, Chedjou did not make his top-flight debut until the age of 22, but he has not looked back since. He moved to Spain as a teenager and joined the youth ranks of Villarreal, but wound up in France, where he has played for Pau, Axerre and Rouen before settling down with Lille, playing over 150 league games for them. In 2013, big-spending Turkish club Galatasaray made Lille an offer they could not refuse, and the 27-year-old joined up with Didier Drogba and Emmanuel Eboue. English Premier League clubs Newcastle United and Liverpool were also said to have been chasing Chedjou's signature before he decided to join the Turkish club. Chedjou represented his country at the Olympic Games in 2008, where the team advanced to the quarter-finals after beating Honduras and drawing with Korea Republic and Italy. In the quarter-finals they faced a star-studded Brazilian side, who won 2-0 after extra time. A year later Chedjou was called-up into the senior side and played in the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™ qualifying campaign. Coach Paul Le Guen selected him for the Indomitable Lions squad for the tournament but the defender played just once – against the Netherlands when the Indomitable Lions had already been eliminated from the competition. He has since commanded a regular place in the team and played in all but one of Cameroon's matches during qualifying for Brazil.

Although her prefers the right-back position, the tall, France-born defender can deputise across the line, which makes him a valuable resource in a tournament setting for the Indomitable Lions. Nyom's club career has taken several unexpected paths. Born in Neuilly-sur Seine, he was a youth player with Nancy, before joining Arles-Avignon, who were then competing in the lower French leagues. Although he never played above the third tier of French football, he was signed by Serie A club Udinese in 2009 and signed a five-year deal with the club. Udinese in turn loaned him out to Spanish club Granada straight away. He soon became a regular for the Andalusian club and helped them gain promotion to the first division. Nyom has played more than 100 games in La Liga and in April was in the Granada side that secured the club's first victory against Barcelona since 1972. Last year he extended his contract with Udinese, even though he has yet to play for them.

He has already begun to stamp his authority as a no-nonsense defender in America’s top-flight, which has only helped Gonzalez’s confidence as he prepares to take on the likes of England, Italy and Uruguay at Brazil 2014.

        "Michael UMANA": "A veteran FIFA World Cup™ participant and journeyman with an impressive 65 caps to his name, Michael Umana will feature in prominently in Costa Rica's defence at Brazil 2014. Umana offers coach Jorge Luis Pinto and fellow team-mates a calming influence, steady leadership and careful decision-making abilities - attributes only a footballer intimately familiar with the international stage could take on with his grace and poise.  During his time with Herediano, Umana represented Costa Rica at the Men's Olympic Football Tournament Greece 2004, where they lost to eventual winners Argentina in the quarter-finals. After a brief stint with LA Galaxy, Umana returned to Costa Rica to play for Brujas. Umana featured for  at Germany 2006 where they endured a searing 4-2 loss to the host country and subsequent defeats to Ecuador and Poland.   After making an early exit from the World Cup, Umana returned back to Herediano and has since shifted between various clubs in the Americas, including another stint in MLS with Chivas USA. He now plays for Costa Rican club Saprissa where he has been since early 2013. Umana will look at Brazil 2014 to improve upon his past international performances and bring his wealth of knowledge and experience to an exciting and gritty side.  "

        "Oscar DUARTE": "Born in Nicaragua, Costa Rica’s neighbours to the north, Oscar Duarte began acclimating himself to the Costa Rican football scene in the Saprissa youth programme. After five years, 52 appearances and 2 goals for Saprissa at the professional level, Duarte joined Club Brugge of the Belgian Pro League in 2013.  While he is still relatively untested on the international level, Duarte was a part of an experimental side at the 2011 UNCAF Copa Centroamerica where Costa Rica finished second, losing the final 2-1 to Honduras, though the centre-back failed to see any action. Then-coach Ricardo La Volpe said of the youngsters at the competition: “The experience that the young lads have picked up is incredibly important.” Coach Jorge Luis Pinto will be hoping that experience gained back then, and in more recent call-ups - he has ten caps to his name to date - leads to a confident young Duarte who could be called upon at any point to help shut down opposing threats at Brazil 2014.

        "Waylon FRANCIS": "Waylon Francis was largely overlooked by Jorge Luis Pinto during FIFA World Cup™ qualifying, but a strong stretch of play in the early months of 2014, combined with Bryan Oviedo’s untimely injury, has earned the left-back a ticket to Brazil 2014. Like many of his international team-mates, Francis started his career in the Saprissa youth set-up. However, he made his professional debut in the Primera Division for Brujas in 2001. After a brief stay at Limon, Francis moved to Herediano, where began to truly make a name for himself, particularly in the CONCACAF Champions League.  His play caught the attention of several Major League Soccer sides, and in November 2013 Columbus Crew acquired Francis as a discovery player and he has since excelled for the Ohio-based outfit, starting in the club’s first ten games of the 2014 campaign. His play in USA’s top-flight impressed Pinto enough to make his 23-man squad for the World Cup, despite having only featured for  during the 2013 Copa Centroamericana, which was hosted and won by Pinto’s side. If his recent performances are any indication of what can be expected of the 23-year old in the future, Francis is certainly shaping up to be a bright prospect of Costa Rica’s backline. And while he may not feature prominently for Pinto at Brazil 2014, the experience gained at football’s biggest stage will only help the young defender in future international match-ups. "

Diaz earned his first cap nearly 11 years ago in a friendly against China PR in September 2003 and has since made regular appearances with the Costa Rican national team, filling in admirably as either a fullback or box-to-box midfielder.  Outside of international appearances, Diaz has led a varied international career. After four years and ten goals for Herediano, the already experienced defender joined Polish side Wisla Krakow in 2007, a team he returned to on loan after his transfer to Club Brugge in Belgium. After two years with the Belgians, Diaz moved east to Mainz in Germany in 2012. After a disappointingly missing out on South Africa 2010, dropping the intercontinental play-off to Urugay, Diaz will surely be looking to show his mettle at football’s greatest stage. Whether Pinto plans to play Diaz in the midfield or in a more likely defensive posture remains to be seen, but his speed, agility and solid first touch will be very useful anywhere in the Costa Rican side.

Gamboa began his professional career with Municipal Liberia and during his short stay he helped the team win the 2009 Clausura. Gamboa then joined Fredrickstad FK in Norway in the summer of 2010, appearing 27 times and scoring one goal in the process. A year later, the young midfielder transferred to Danish Superliga side FC Copenhagen, where he joined up with compatriot Brian Oviedo. Together they helped the club clinch the Danish Cup in 2011. Gamboa returned rather quickly to Norway in 2012, however, this time taking up a spot with Rosenborg. Despite success at the club level, Gamboa faced a difficult time breaking into the Costa Rican first team, even after putting in several solid shifts for  at the FIFA U-20 World Cup Egypt 2009. His first cap with the senior side came in January 2010 against Argentina.

        "Roy MILLER": "A lanky defender, Roy Miller has been shoring up backlines for numerous overseas sides since his 2005 transfer from Cartagines. Regardless of where he plays his club football, he has been a constant presence in the national team picture since the days of his youth. Unsurprisingly, he now holds one of 23 coveted places on Jorge Luis Pinto’s squad at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ and will undoubtedly be a frequently used asset to the team. After a rocky start to his professional career, Miller joined Norway’s Bodo. He had a successful stay with the Norwegian club and provided six goals over the course of 52 appearances, and consistently impressive performances earned him increased interest from other Nordic teams. In 2008, Miller signed a three-year long contract with the Norwegian side Rosenborg. He rapidly asserted himself as the teams’ leading left back, but his rise was cut short by a knee injury, followed by a successful and well received loan to Orgryte.  In 2010, Miller crossed the Atlantic to join his North American neighbours, the New York Red Bulls. In a well-timed turn of events, Miller’s MLS debut was a 3-1 victory over Santos in the very first game to be played in the then-brand new Red Bull Arena. Miller continued his contract with the Red Bulls in 2013 and remains consistently in the starting XI for the MLS Eastern Conference squad today. Miller featured for  at the FIFA U-17 World Cup Trinidad and Tobago 2001 alongside current team-mate Carlos Johnson and helped Costa Rica qualify for Germany 2006, though he was unlucky not to be named to that tournament’s final squad. He would continue to feature during the doomed-South Africa 2010 qualification and, most recently, throughout Costa Rica’s successful Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign. "

At the tender of age of just 22, he already appears to be a fixture in the  defence for years to come, chiefly because of his biggest asset: versatility. In what is a huge plus for any coach, Vrsaljko is capable of turning out in either of the full-back positions. Like compatriot and superstar Luka Modric, Vrsaljko grew up in Zadar, but it is not just their shared roots that have led to comparisons between the two. Like Modric, Vrsaljko also played for Dinamo Zagreb, during which time he developed into a player of refined technical ability. After winning seven trophies in four years with the nation’s record title-winners, he transferred to Italian side Genoa in 2013. Having represented his country from U-17 to U-21 level, Vrsaljko made his senior debut in February 2011 under Slaven Bilic and was part of the squad that qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™, although he only made one appearance.

His international career began brightly: he made his senior debut in November 2004 and then became a familiar face the in the squad, participating at both the 2006 FIFA World Cup™ in Germany and UEFA EURO 2008. However, after publicly criticising the national team’s sporting set-up in 2011, he was banned from the squad by then coach Slaven Bilic. He was recalled by Bilic’s successor Igor Stimac but only featured fleetingly in the early days of Stimac’s tenure, and did not play a single minute of his country’s qualification campaign for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil. That period out in the cold was then ended when new coach Niko Kovac brought him back into the first-team fold for the World Cup play-off against Iceland in November 2013. Pranjic soon repaid his coach’s trust, helping the 1998 FIFA World Cup semi-finalists book their ticket for Brazil. At club level Pranjic’s most notable successes have come with Bayern Munich, with whom he reached two UEFA Champions League finals and won the league title. Previously he had helped Dutch top-tier outfit SC Heerenveen win their domestic cup, before leaving for Germany in 2009, even financing part of the transfer himself. He has also represented Dinamo Zagreb, Sporting Lisbon and Panathinaikos, making him one of Croatia’s most experienced players. Pranjic is able to play on the left side of both attack and defence, as well as in central midfield. "

Given that the former will be suspended at the tournament, the weight of defensive responsibility will fall squarely on Corluka’s shoulders. The 28-year-old, who can play both in the centre and on the right side of defence, has earned over 70 caps since making his senior debut in 2006, after previously representing his country at various youth levels. Corluka is one of the side’s more seasoned players and gained major international tournament experience at the last two European Championships. The imposing defender left Dinamo Zagreb aged 21 after English Premier League side Manchester City secured his signature. Following subsequent transfers to Tottenham Hotspur and Bayer Leverkusen, Corluka ended up at Lokomotiv Moscow in 2012, having been recruited by Slaven Bilic, his coach with Croatia between 2006 and 2012.

In recent years, he has often had to play second fiddle to more established members of the national team, such as Josip Simunic and Vedran Corluka. Simunic’s lengthy ban could provide an opportunity for Lovren to break into the starting line-up. He made seven appearances during Croatia’s World Cup qualifying campaign and has appeared for every youth side from the U-17s onwards, receiving his first call-up to the full national team at the age of just 19. Olympique Lyon became aware of his talents in 2010 and soon brought him to France from Dinamo Zagreb. After three successful seasons at Lyon, he joined English Premier League outfit Southampton. Lovren was born in 1989 in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina (formerly of Yugoslavia). The outbreak of civil war forced his family to flee to Munich, but they soon returned and it was not long before they settled in Karlovac near Zagreb, where Dejan was raised. "

With over 100 international caps, he has worn the captain’s armband for almost six years after taking over from current national team boss Niko Kovac after the Blazers’ UEFA EURO 2008 quarter-final exit against Turkey. Kovac will no doubt be counting on his former team-mate’s vast experience, which encompasses the 2004, 2008 and 2012 EUROs, as well as the 2006 FIFA World Cup™, in Brazil this summer. The defender enjoys similar standing in his adopted homeland of Ukraine. Since 2003 the 32-year-old has plied his trade for Shakhtar Donetsk, captaining the side to a string of national titles, as well as the 2009 UEFA Cup – the highlight of his club career to date. Previously he spent four years with Hajduk Split in his homeland. Srna is also a free-kick specialist and takes responsibility for set-pieces at both club and international level. He is also renowned for his tenacious playing style, as former national coach Slaven Bilic explained: “Kicking him won’t stop him. Even if he’s lying on the floor in pain, he’s up on his feet again before you know it – almost like Robocop.” "

Then came stints in Turkey (Besiktas), Germany (Duisburg and later Eintracht Frankfurt), Austria (Sturm Graz), Russia (Dinamo Moscow) and finally Greece, where he now plays for Panathinaikos, having also spent time on loan at PAOK Salonika. As well as his vast experience, he has also picked up league-winner's medals in both Austria and Croatia. He made his debut for the national team in 2009 and three years later at UEFA EURO 2012 received his first taste of football at a major tournament, playing in all three of his country’s group games. The tough-tackling defender spent much of Croatia’s campaign to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ waiting in the wings behind first-choice defensive pairing Josip Simunic and Vedran Corluka, making just four appearances.

Born in Osijek, Vida attracted the attentions of numerous European clubs with his performances for hometown club NK Osijek.

A solid defender with a strong physique and great ability in the air, Guagua has had a somewhat nomadic career since making the breakthrough at Naval. After cementing his reputation at El Nacional, where he won two league titles, the then youngster sought out pastures new at Argentinian outfit Colon. Notwithstanding a season in Mexico with Atlante, he has spent the last seven years back in Ecuador with five different clubs: Emelec, Barcelona, Deportivo Quito, El Nacional again and most notably Liga de Quito, with whom he won another domestic championship and the 2010 Recopa Sudamericana. Guagua featured in the 2001 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Argentina, shortly after making his first senior international appearance in a qualifier for Japan/Korea 2002. He also featured in qualifying for Germany 2006, South Africa 2010 and Brazil 2014 and has been a member of three Copa America squads (2001, 2004 and 2007).

He won the Ecuadorian title as a youngster at El Nacional, where he spent the early years of his career, a short-lived loan spell at Tecnico Universitario aside. After being snapped up by Guayaquil side Barcelona, his consistent performances helped him clinch another league title and then a move to Brazilian giants Flamengo at the beginning of 2014. Since making his senior international debut in a 2011 Copa America warm-up fixture against Argentina in Mar del Plata (he would go on to feature in the tournament proper), Erazo has become a virtual ever-present at the heart of the Ecuador defence.

He was on the move again before too long, though, briefly playing for Deportivo Cuenca and then dropping down the divisions to help third-tier Rocafuerte gain promotion to Serie B. Following another stint at Deportivo Cuenca, where he finished second in the league, the full-back won his first top-flight title at Deportivo Quito in 2011 before going full circle by rejoining Barcelona last year.

Several years in the international wilderness followed before Reinaldo Rueda recalled Bagui for a couple of friendlies in 2013.

It proved to be a major turning point in his life. \\r\\n He returned to Valencia after a spell with the Madrid-based side, but was soon on his way back to the Spanish capital when came calling in 2009. He accepted his position in the bench with no complaints as he was still in the plans of the national coach, though also in the bench. In 2013, he signed with Napoli and now, finally, he has a more prominent position in the club.  Standing at 1.87 m, Albiol’s aerial ability is one of his main assets, although his positioning, unflinching tackling and distribution from the back are equally effective. Albiol has been a regular in  squads ever since making his international debut in October 2007. He has formed part of the historic achievements of a uniquely successful crop of players, winning the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™ as well as successive UEFA EUROs in 2008 and 2012. "

Strong, intelligent and technically gifted, Pique has, over the years, earned the nickname  in honour of legendary German sweeper  Franz Beckenbauer. His powerful physique and strong aerial ability means he is both a commanding defensive presence and a real threat in the opposition's penalty area. And while clearly a danger from set-pieces, Pique is also known for his ability to bring the ball out of defence and use his skill and vision to join attacks. After spending most of his youth career at Barcelona, Pique moved to England at 17 and joined Manchester United, gaining his first taste of European football. He then spent 2006/07 on loan at Real Zaragoza, before returning to his native Catalonia to rejoin . In his maiden season he won every club honour available, and also earned his first senior cap for Spain. Pique has represented Spain at all levels, and was part of the side that won the UEFA European U-19 Championship in 2006. Vicente del Bosque gave him his first senior outing for  in February 2009.

The full-back then enjoyed five years with Osasuna before returning to the Spanish capital to pull on the red and white jersey of Atletico Madrid, where sustained success has come his way. \\r\\nThough originally signed to replace Simao on the right side of attack, Juanfran was forced by circumstances to switch to a more defensive role, eventually cementing his place in the side at right-back. Quick, watchful and incisive whenever he pushes forward, he is ideally suited to the position. \\r\\nHe also had a distinguished youth career with Spain, forming part of the sides that won the UEFA European Under-19 Championship in 2004 and appeared at the FIFA U-20 World Cups in the UAE in 2003 (where  finished runners-up) and in the Netherlands in 2005.

Ramos made his name as an attacking right-back but has more recently been deployed in central defence, where he has excelled over the past season. His powerful physique and heading ability makes him a real threat in the air, particularly at set-pieces, from which he has scored an impressive number of goals down the years.

A move to Valencia followed a year later, where he fine-tuned his famed body swerves, speed and lung-busting bursts forward. Upon reaching the first team, coach Unay Emery converted Alba into a left-back, a move which has paid rich dividends.\\r\\n Vicente del Bosque handed him a debut appearance for in October 2011 and Alba was included in Spain’s UEFA EURO 2012 squad after just eight international outings. He swiftly made the left-back position his own and was a key member of the title-winning side, crowning an outstanding tournament with a goal in the final against Italy. That was enough to persuade Barcelona to bring Alba home, where he is developing into a left-back in the classical Brazilian style: an attack-minded defender who gets forward at every opportunity. The only blot on his copy book came at the Men’s Olympic Football Tournament at London 2012, as Spain fell at the first hurdle and returned home after the group stage. "

It was fair recognition for a player who had developed into one of the best right-backs in Ligue 1, underlining the exciting new level he was reaching. He contested the qualifying campaign ahead of UEFA EURO 2012 and then appeared in the finals as a first-choice starter, and he has continued to be a reliable performer on France\\'s right flank since Didier Deschamps took the reins.

Since his days as a youth player in and around Paris, Evra has forged the mentality of a warrior and racked up an impressive level of experience, having first moved abroad to join third-tier Italian side Marsala aged just 17. Quickly spotted by Monza, he climbed up a division, only to return to France a season later to sign for Nice.  \\r\\nIt was with Nice's local rivals Monaco that Evra really began turning heads, however, playing a full part as the principality side finished runners-up in the UEFA Champions League under Didier Deschamps in 2003/04.

UEFA EURO 2008 proved a low point, but worse was to come at South Africa 2010, where Evra captained a side that disappointed supporters both on and off the pitch.

He started playing professional football with CS Wépionnais, before moving on to UR Namur, where he was spotted by a scout from Standard Liege.  Mangala made his debut for the Belgian giants in 2008 aged only 17 and it was here, alongside a generation of superstars including Axel Witsel and Steven Defour that he kicked off his career in style by winning both the domestic league and the Belgian Supercup, and, two years later, adding the Belgian Cup to the list. It was during this 2010-2011 season that he caught the attention of FC Porto, and at the end of it the Portuguese club killed two birds with one stone, signing Defour along with the Frenchman. After a season settling in, Mangala took advantage of the Brazilian Maicon’s injury to establish himself in Porto’s defence. He is a powerful footballer, always in the right place, good with his head and on the counter, as well as being a threat in the opposition box from dead-ball situations. After bagging his second consecutive championship title in Portugal, Mangala was called up by Didier Deschamps for the first time in June 2013.

The Hanover-born star had wanted to quit playing football as a youngster but, after experiencing a late surge, Mertesacker made his Bundesliga debut for Hannover 96 just after his 19th birthday. After only 20 league appearances, he received his first call-up to the national side.

Boasting an imposing physique, he is adept at using both feet, is good in the air and an excellent tackler. To these attributes he has also crucially improved his passing and ability to orchestrate attacks from the back. The son of a German mother and a Ghanaian father, Boateng’s first club was Tennis Borussia Berlin - formerly a familiar name in German professional football - whom he joined at the age of ten, before his discovery by city powerhouses Hertha Berlin three years later.

It was clear from an early stage that, like Kevin-Prince, Jerome was destined for greatness. In the summer of 2007, he moved to Hamburg and in 2010 to Manchester City.

The son of Albanian immigrants, Mustafi grew up in Germany and was discovered as a teenager playing in an indoor football tournament for the youth team of amateur club Rotenburg. From there he progressed through the Hamburg youth system, switching from striker to defender in the process. He was just 17 when Mustafi made the move to England to play for Everton. Strong and fiercely competitive, Mustafi has played for Germany at every level from U-16 through to U-21. In the 2009 UEFA European Under-17 Championship he played every minute of every game, and was one of the key players as Germany lifted the trophy.

The coach even had enough confidence in the youngster to award him a place in the starting XI for the two crucial play-off matches against Egypt.\\r\\nThe centre-back began his professional career with Ebusua Dwarfs in Ghana's top tier. After a move to French club Lens fell through, he signed for Kumasi giants Asante Kotoko, where he played just one season before being lured to the South African Premier League and Mamelodi Sundowns. He became an instant hit in Pretoria, before picking up an ill-timed injury. He struggled to regain his place in the team and was dropped by Appiah for Ghana's international friendly in March against Montenegro. Sumaila said at the time: “If I stay fit, I will make it to Brazil. I know that staying fit and keeping good form will get me a place at the World Cup.” His words proved prophetic too. "

This tall and rangy centre-back played in all but one of his country's matches at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2009 as Sellas Tetteh's side won the tournament for the first time in their history. Mensah’s impressive performances at that competition in Egypt earned him a spot in the side that went to the following year's FIFA World Cup™. He appeared in three matches at South Africa 2010 as Ghana came agonisingly close to becoming the first African country to reach the semi-finals.   Mensah began his career at Ashanti Gold before joining Free State Stars in 2008. He spent two seasons in South Africa and proved a real gem for the provincial outfit, becoming a sensation with his oft-times enthusiastic – and sometimes reckless – tackling and commitment to the cause. He moved to Italy and Udinese two years later, but failed to break through to the first team, instead moving on loan to Spanish club Granada. His next port of call was current club Evian, who at the time had just been promoted to the French top-flight. Mensah will have a special wish for his birthday this year: to play football on the actual day. The defender turns 24 on 13 July – the day of the Brazil 2014 Final at the Maracana. "

A maiden Serie A appearance followed the very next season against Udinese, but like many other young Italian talents Darmian was forced to go on his travels in search of first-team football, spending time at Padova, Torino and Palermo but playing only 15 top-flight games up to 2012.\\r\\n His fortunes changed when Torino decided to sign him on a permanent deal. Earning a regular starting place as the 2012/13 season got under way, he established himself as one of the best full-backs in Serie A. A first choice also at every age level for Italy, Darmian caught the eye of Cesare Prandelli during another fine season with the Turin club and was invited to a national team training camp in March 2014, the prelude to his appearance in the coach’s 23-man list for Brazil 2014.

        "Ignazio ABATE": "Easily recognisable thanks to his blond hair and white boots, Italy and AC Milan right-back Ignazio Abate is the son of former Udinese and Inter Milangoalkeeper Beniamino Abate. Very quick and always keen to get forward, the 26-year-old enjoyed a rapid impact at international level, needing just a few months to relegate Italy stalwarts Massimo Oddo and Gianluca Zambrotta to the sidelines.   Abate rose through the ranks at Milan and was handed a first-team debut against Celta Viga in the UEFA Champions League on 3 December 2003, but he spent the next six years at a selection of clubs around Italy, having been loaned out to accelerate his progress.   A winger when he first started out, Abate took up position on the right side of midfield during that spell, before being repurposed as a modern-style full-back when Leonardo brought him back to Milan in 2009. It was a shrewd switch, and two years later on 11 November 2011, Abate won his maiden Italy cap against Poland.    A starter at UEFA EURO 2012, he contested three games in Poland and Ukraine and has racked up nine appearances in total, with his versatility making him an attractive option for Cesare Prandelli regardless of the system he implements.

Since joining Juventus in 2011, he has played regularly alongside Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci in a three-man back line, and the trio have developed an understanding crucial to their performances with .  \\r\\nHailing from Tuscany, Barzagli turned professional in 1998 at the age of 17, but he had to wait until August 2003 to make his Serie A debut, featuring for Chievo. The solid stopper impressed during his time at the Verona club and, 15 months later, after tying down a regular starting place with Palermo, he was handed his first Italy cap in a 1-0 win over Finland. Barzagli quickly proved his worth at international level and helped his country clinch the 2006 FIFA World Cup™, yet his career took a serious dip following the 3-0 loss to the Netherlands at UEFA EURO 2008. The experienced defender decided to take his talents to Wolfsburg to get himself back on track, before eventually returning to Italy to sign for .

        "Leonardo BONUCCI": "Leonardo Bonucci is a vital component of the Italy defence, lining up in between Juventus team-mates Giorgio Chiellini and Andrea Barzagli. Born near to Rome, the centre-back joined Milan at the age of 18. His debut in Serie A came in May 2006, but competition for places meant his playing time with was limited. He was loaned out to Treviso and later Pisa, before being sold to Genoa who then agreed a co-ownership deal with Bari. Bonucci finally began turning heads while at the latter club in 2009/10, and he was snapped up by Juve at the end of the season. On the international stage, he was first capped aged 22 by Marcello Lippi, despite never having represented his country at any other age group. He started the match next to Fabio Cannavaro and Chiellini, and he became a permanent fixture in the side following the former’s retirement and Italy’s disappointing 2010 FIFA World Cup™ campaign - in which he did not feature once. Since 2010, he has been a key figure in the  side, and equally valuable to the  line-up. The converted midfielder regularly earns praise for his excellent technique which allows him to distribute the ball with pace and precision. Physically imposing at 6’2, not to mention good in the air and inspired in his passing, Bonucci has all the attributes of the ideal modern centre-back. "

        "Gabriel PALETTA": "The 21stArgentinian-born player to represent Italy, Gabriel Paletta is the most recent  talent to have been brought into the  fold. Athletic, tough in the tackle and strong in the air, he is most at home on the left side of central defence and could easily have been cut from the same mould as former  legend Roberto Ayala. Born in Buenos Aires, Paletta won the 2005 FIFA U-20 World Cup with his native country and represented the U-20s seven times overall but never made the step up to the senior team. He was therefore able to switch allegiances as he boasts dual nationality, his grandfather Vincenzo having emigrated to Argentina from Calabria. \\r\\nAt club level, Paletta started out at Banfield before leaving for Liverpool, where he spent most of his single season on the margins. The Anfield outfit subsequently let him join Boca Juniors and, after three years back in Argentina, the defender signed for Parma in 2010. That eventually brought him onto Cesare Prandelli's radar and the Italy coach handed him his debut against Spain in March, having spent several months trying to locate a new centre-back. Paletta has tended to suffer from ligament problems, but he is a solid presence at the back and steeped in football. Indeed, all three of his brothers are involved in the game at various levels: Hector is a referee, Ariel a stock-controller and Daniel a physical trainer. "

        "Atsuto UCHIDA": "Schalke defender Atsuto Uchida sets many female football supporters’ hearts aflutter, but beneath the handsome exterior is a fiercely determined, attack-minded player who is developing into a world-class right back. Now a regular starter in the Bundesliga, Uchida has also become an integral player for the Samurai Blue under coach Alberto Zaccheroni.  Uchida’s professional career began at J.League giants Kashima Antlers while he was still a teenager. He nailed down a regular starting spot in his first season, and his penetrating runs down the right flank added an edge to Kashima’s attack and contributed to the club winning three consecutive league titles. Uchida made his national debut in 2008, but despite being selected for the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ in South Africa, he spent the tournament on the bench.  To take his game to a higher level, Uchida signed for Schalke in 2010. He produced some eye-catching performances in the Bundesliga and Champions League, and the 26-year-old is now widely regarded as one of the finest members of Japan’s European contingent. Strategically astute, skilful and quick, Uchida’s understanding with Inter Milan’s dynamic left back Yuto Nagatomo gives Japan genuine attacking options on both wings and could hold the key to the Samurai Blue’s chances of reaching the quarter-finals at a FIFA World Cup for the first time.

        "Gotoku SAKAI": "An attacking full-back with the full complement of skills, Gotoku Sakai is a rising star of Japanese football. Aggressive in defence, the 23-year-old has a penchant for breaking forward to create overlaps and poses a real threat with his accurate crosses and mid-range shots – often after cutting infield from the right.  Sakai began his professional career with Albirex Niigata and became a regular starter in 2010. Deployed as an attacking midfielder, he moved seamlessly through the national team age-categories while a teenager, announcing himself as a player for the future. Although he was not named in the squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup™, coach Takeshi Okada chose him and attacking midfielder Shinji Kagawa as “support members” to accompany the team to South Africa. Sakai represented Japan at the 2012 London Olympics, where he was central to the team’s progression to the semi-finals.  In the winter of 2012, the player was loaned to Germany’s VfB Stuttgart, before making his full international debut that same year. Moreover, his move to Stuttgart was made permanent in 2013, another indication that Sakai’s career is on the rise.  Sakai can play on either flank but nonetheless faces intense competition for a starting berth. At right back, his rivals include Atsuto Uchida and Hiroki Sakai, who both also play in the Bundesliga, while Inter Milan’s Yuto Nagatomo seems a shoo-in on the left.  "

        "Yuto NAGATOMO": "Japan’s premier left back, Yuto Nagatomo is a committed defender who adds a further dimension to his side’s attacking threat thanks to his weaving runs and overlaps. The pocket-sized Nagatomo is a tireless worker, technically sound and can pass and shoot accurately with both feet—qualities that have made the 27-year-old a regular starter for Inter Milan and the Samurai Blue.  Although Nagatomo is a household name in Japan now, he barely registered on the football radar during his high school years – perhaps a result of his family’s long association with cycling and rugby. Even at Meiji University, he was perhaps better know for playing a drum in the stands during his team’s games than for his on-field exploits. However, his fortunes changed dramatically after his coach at university converted him from a midfielder to an attacking wing-back.  Nagatomo’s remarkable rise to prominence began in 2007, when he made his debut for J.League club FC Tokyo while still enrolled at university. The following year, he officially signed with the club and received his first international cap.  At the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ in South Africa, Nagatomo’s skills shone through as he repelled the efforts of some of the world’s top strikers. The manner in which he nullified Cameroon’s ace striker Samuel Eto’o in the opening group game and his tight marking during the tournament helped propel Japan to the Round of 16. Nagatomo was signed by Serie A club Cesena soon after the FIFA World Cup, and he joined Inter Milan in the winter of 2011. \\r\\n"

Born in Hiroshima Prefecture, he came through the junior system of local club Sanfrecce, but was not picked for the youth programme.  Morishige kept pursuing his football dream and after finishing high school made his professional debut for Oita Trinita. Although originally a defensive midfielder, Trinita converted him into a mainstay of a three-man backline. His improved performances saw him selected for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where Japan lost all three of their group games. Morishige had better luck with Oita that year as the club won the J.League Cup.  His reached a turning point in his career in 2010, when he was signed by FC Tokyo and formed a superb partnership with Japan’s Yasuyuki Konno. Tokyo preferred to deploy Morishige again as a defensive midfielder, and he also became a free-kick specialist. Despite a relatively young age, his status within the side grew to such an extent that he has been captain since 2013.  Despite frequent call-ups to the national team squad, Morishige has struggled to get regular playing time. Nevertheless, his physical style of play could be a useful attribute at the FIFA World Cup™ in Brazil. "

Konno grew up in Miyagi Prefecture in north-eastern Japan, but local J.League club Vegalta Sendai did not offer him a contract after he finished high school. Just when Konno was resigned himself to playing amateur football, he received an offer to join Consadole Sapporo from former Samurai Blue coach Takeshi Okada, who had been impressed by his defensive nous and tenacity. Konno made the most of his opportunity and rapidly became a regular starter for Consadole in a midfield anchorman role, while he also went on to represent Japan at Under-20 and Under-23 level. In 2004, he transferred to FC Tokyo and started all three of Japan’s group games at the Olympic Football Tournament Athens 2004.  Konno made his senior international debut the following year, but was not selected for the 2006 FIFA World Cup™ in Germany. Konno enjoyed a renaissance in the national team when his old mentor Okada returned as Japan coach and he played briefly at South Africa 2010.  Comfortable playing anywhere in the defensive line or as a holding midfielder, Konno also has the knack for making crucial interceptions. Since 2012, the 31-year-old has lined up in the colours of Gamba, where he is an automatic starter alongside fellow international Yasuhito Endo. "

While still at university, he was chosen for Japan’s FIFA U-20 World Cup squad in 2005, although he would be an unused squad member.  Having tasted the big time, the teenager cut short his studies and signed with FC Tokyo the following year. However, a lack of starting opportunities there stalled his career, and in 2008 Inoha moved to Kashima Antlers, the team he supported as a boy. He helped Kashima win two league titles before a desire to take his game to a new level prompted a switch to Croatian first-division club Hajduk Split in July 2011. Problematic circumstances at the club resulted in Inoha soon returning to Japan, where he signed with Vissel Kobe in 2012. After Kobe were relegated at the end of that season, Inoha moved on to top-flight side Jubilo Iwata.  The 28-year-old is a tight marker who intercepts more than his share of passes thanks to excellent positioning, Inoha adds considerable steel to the defensive line. Coach Alberto Zaccheroni has regularly selected Inoha for the national squad, and perhaps his finest moment for the Samurai Blue came when he scored the winning goal in the 3-2 quarter-final victory against Qatar at the AFC Asian Cup 2011.

The 23-year-old burst onto the international scene when he scored for Kashiwa against Brazilian powerhouse Santos at the FIFA Club World Cup Japan 2011. That goal was especially sweet for Sakai, who has close ties with Brazil. After turning pro, he spent some time in Sao Paulo, where he was ingrained with a relentless work ethic in defence and attack. After returning to the J.League, Sakai’s game blossomed and he became the bedrock of the Reysol defence.   Sakai earned his first cap for Japan in May 2012 and was transferred to German club Hannover later that year.

After coming through the Nagoya Grampus youth academy, Yoshida benefited from the tutelage of coach Dragan Stojkovic, who played for Yugoslavia at the 1990 and 1998 FIFA World Cups™. Stojkovic focused on the technical aspects of Yoshida’s game, and his rapid improvement set him up for higher honours.  Yoshida became a pillar of the Samurai Blue defence after he transferred to Dutch club VVV-Venlo in the winter of 2010. Alberto Zaccheroni made him a central figure in his set-up, and he was vital to Japan’s triumph at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. In 2012, he captained Japan as one of the over-age players at the London Olympics, where his side finished just outside the medals in fourth. This was Yoshida’s second Olympics, and his experience was invaluable as he marshalled his younger team-mates.  In August that year, he signed for Premier League club Southampton. The 25-year-old has steadily developed into one of Asia’s leading centre backs, a distinction that reflects his fine organisational skills and the aerial threat he poses from set pieces.

The full-back made only two appearances in Serie A, however, and returned home the following year to sign for mighty Club America.  fans were reluctant to embrace the little-known new arrival and took to the social media to blame him for the team’s defeats.\\r\\nUndaunted, the young defender stuck quietly and determinedly to his task and used his pace, precise passing and long-range shooting skills to consolidate his place in the  first team. He proved influential in America’s Clausura 2013 win, scoring the penalty that sealed the title for them.\\r\\nBy this time the fans that once criticised him had become his most vociferous supporters and urged his inclusion in the national team. Their calls were answered when Jose Manuel de la Torre brought him into the squad for the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Layun stayed in the frame under Victor Manuel Vucetich and Miguel Herrera, for whom he has become an essential component in Mexico’s attack-minded 5-3-2 formation."

        "Hector MORENO": "A key member of the famous ‘Golden Generation’ that lifted the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Peru, Hector Moreno has established himself as one of the Mexican national side’s most important players over the last few years. A cornerstone of the Mexican rearguard, the centre-back’s reliability has seen him become a firm favourite with fans at two different European clubs, first with Eredivisie outfit AZ Alkmaar and then with current team Espanyol, where he is one of their most highly regarded performers. An excellent man marker, the defender is comfortable with the ball at his feet and formidable in the air. He commits very few errors and knows how to motivate his team-mates when necessary. The 26-year-old has been linked with moves to some of the biggest clubs in Spain, Italy and England in the past, and that may provide him with an extra incentive to put in some strong displays at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™. \\r\\nWhile Moreno’s profile outside of Mexico, Spain and the Netherlands remains low, it is possible that this summer could provide the springboard that catapults him to global stardom.

        "Miguel PONCE": "Though Miguel Ponce only sneaked into Mexico's FIFA World Cup™ squad as a late stand-in – he was drafted in by coach Miguel Herrera after Juan Carlos Medina was ruled out through injury – the speedy, defensively disciplined left-back has everything in his locker to make an impression in Brazil. A member of Mexico’s gold medal-winning squad at the 2012 Olympics in London, Ponce is not just a fine player: he also has an interesting story. The 25-year-old was actually born in the USA, namely in Sacramento, California, but with two Mexican parents and having spent his entire club career in Mexico, he was delighted when  came calling. The full-back was spotted by Chivas as a teenager and, after making his debut four years ago, chalked up a considerable number of appearances for the Guadalajara outfit. However, his performances have gone up a notch since a loan move to Toluca, forcing Ponce into contention for Brazil 2014, where the squad latecomer will be bidding to prove the truth of the expression “last, but not least”.

The skilful 27-year-old left wingback has spent most of his career in Europe, making his name with a successful spell at Deportivo La Coruna before joining Valencia, and now at most recently Bayer Leverkusen.   (little prince) has been ever-present for Mexico, surviving the various managerial changes that have taken place since his first outings. Over the years he has been considered one of 's most potent attacking threats, thanks in no small part to his speed and dribbling ability, but he now plays a more defensive role, both in club and country. Guardado also has some unfinished business at international level. Indeed, having been first-choice for most of Mexico's qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, he lost his starting role at the very end and was on and off the bench throughout the finals in South Africa.

Paul Aguilar was the first-choice option at the start of the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™, and he stands a good chance of reprising the role in Brazil.\\r\\n Since South Africa 2010, Aguilar has grown to become one of the most dependable right-backs in Mexican football. He made his name with Pachuca, his first club, before joining America, for whom he has impressed with his consistent displays in the past three short tournaments. As a fullback Aguilar tends to favour attack over defence, and he could provide a useful outlet if required by Mexico coach Jose Manuel de la Torre. "

At 29, the Aston Villa captain arrives at Brazil 2014 approaching his peak - and determined to make up for lost time. After all, Vlaar was one of the names cut from Bert van Marwijk’s 36-man preliminary squad in 2010, and had to watch from home as his fellow countrymen marched all the way to the Final. His potential has long been recognised, with the former AZ and Feyenoord man a key player in the Dutch U-21 sides that won back-to-back European titles in 2006 and 2007. Establishing himself at senior level has proved more difficult, and despite finally gaining a place in the side by the time UEFA EURO 2012 came about, Vlaar and his team-mates endured a campaign that brought only disappointment and frustration.  Now, at the end of another tough season with Villa, battling in the lower reaches of the Premier League, this tall and commanding centre-half is determined to make an impression on the biggest stage of all.

Though still just 22, he is firmly established as the Rotterdam outfit’s captain, having assumed the armband at the age of 20 when Ron Vlaar departed for Aston Villa. That honour reflects the maturity with which the centre-half conducts himself on and off the field, and the respect that he already commands from team-mates for both club and country.  Such esteem has been earned by consistently assured performances that have helped restore Feyenoord as a force to be reckoned with in the Eredivisie and established their young skipper as a recognised international.  De Vrij just missed out on UEFA EURO 2012, his name one of those cut from the provisional 36-man squad, but he has gone on to make nine appearances under Louis van Gaal since making his debut two years ago. The Netherlands coach clearly sees this classy defender as a future stalwart, and there will be plenty of big clubs watching with interest how he performs at Brazil 2014.  "

        "Bruno MARTINS INDI": "One of the new generation of Dutch stars, Bruno Martins Indi has emerged as a key player for Louis van Gaal during the Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign. Tall, athletic and able to play at both left-back and centre-half, the Feyenoord player has proved himself well capable of rising to the demands of international football since making his senior debut at the age of 20 in August 2012.  Born in Portugal and raised in Rotterdam, where his family moved when he was just three months old, Martins Indi ended any debate over his allegiances by declaring for the Dutch in 2009. That was the year in which he first entered the international fray with a brief appearance at the FIFA U-17 World Cup in Colombia. Further progress at Feyenoord has followed, with manager Ronald Koeman saying that his young defender has the “potential to be world-class” and tipping him to the Netherlands’ first-choice left-back “for the next ten years”. Indeed, Koeman has already conceded defeat in his bid to keep this talented youngster in Rotterdam, and it seems certain that Martins Indi - having nailed down a starting role during the preliminaries - will use Brazil 2014 as a springboard for the first major move of his fledgling career.

        "Daley BLIND": "Having spent the early stages of his career in the shadow of his father, Danny - a stalwart for Ajax and the Netherlands during the 1990s - Daley Blind is now beginning to carve out a formidable reputation of his own. Comfortable both at left-back and in a defensive midfield role, the 24-year-old featured in four of the  FIFA World Cup qualifiers and seems certain to be on the plane to Brazil.  Blind’s breakthrough season came in 2012/13, when he was named Ajax’s player of the year after excelling at left-back throughout the club’s march to the title. More recently, though, he has been fielded by Ronald de Boer as a holding midfielder - a positional switch that has seen him dubbed ‘the Dutch Philipp Lahm’ - and his performances have been every bit as impressive.  Due to Nigel de Jong’s hold on that position in the national team, it is at full-back that he has played most often under Lou Van Gaal, emerging as the team's first-choice No3 as the qualifying campaign reached its conclusion. And whatever role he plays at the FIFA World Cup, Blind’s energy, composure and versatility are sure to make him a key player for the Netherlands for years to come. "

This 24-year-old right-back is, after all, seemingly assured of a place in Louis van Gaal’s side, having started eight of the  ten qualifying matches en route to Brazil 2014. He is also being pursued by several of Europe’s leading clubs, with London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur among those said to be battling it out over a likely summer move.  Feyenoord certainly appear to accept that they are fighting a losing battle in their attempts to hold on to a full-back whose pace, tackling ability and attacking instincts have established him as one of his country’s hottest properties.  Janmaat, a graduate of the Rotterdam club’s youth system who made his name with ADO Den Haag and Heerenveen before returning in 2012, has enjoyed a meteoric rise at international level. Despite only making his debut in September 2012, he quickly made the right-back slot his own and seems sure to be a key component of the Dutch defence that lines up at Brazil 2014.  "

Indeed, it was only last August - a month away from his 30th birthday - that the right-back finally made his first full Oranje appearance in a friendly against Portugal.  Verhaegh was nevertheless one of the surprise inclusions in Louis van Gaal’s Brazil 2014 squad. Nonetheless, Van Gaal has evidently been impressed with the defender’s consistent form for Augsburg, the German club with which he has played since 2010.  A fine defensive record was certainly one of the main reasons behind the Bavarian outfit emerging as one of the Bundesliga’s success stories of 2013/14, and Verhaegh now has the chance to cap the season in style with an unlikely role in Brazil.

Indeed, the Ajax star is reported to have his pick of England’s top clubs should he chose to leave Amsterdam, with Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and the two Manchester clubs all strongly linked.  The Dutch champions, though, are determined to hang on to a player who has been vital to their recent run of success, with director and former Netherlands international Marc Overmars vowing: “I will fight to keep Veltman. He is a massive talent... a sensation. We never expected him to make such an amazing breakthrough.”  Veltman has benefited from the tutelage of another former star, Jaap Stam, at Ajax, and his development led to a first full international call-up last November. Typically, the 22-year-old marked his first cap by helping keep a clean sheet against Colombia, and hopes are high for his prospects at club and international level.  "

Now, a season which, for the most part, was spent warming the bench will end with Kongolo heading to Brazil with his country’s biggest names. The centre-half does at least have plenty of experience of international football at youth level, having represented the Netherlands at various stages from U-15 to U-21.

The former Everton defender started his country’s successful CAF Africa Cup of Nations campaign last year as captain and one of the guaranteed first-choice central defenders, but was restricted to substitute appearances after the opening game against Burkina Faso. Due to the successful nature of the partnership between Godfrey Oboabona and Kenneth Omeruo, Yobo was sidelined during the Super Eagles’ triumphant World Cup qualifying campaign, failing to make a single appearance on the road to Brazil. As a result, he is a surprise inclusion by Keshi but adds a wealth of experience to Nigeria’s squad. Making his full international debut in March 2001, after helping his country to the quarter-finals of the FIFA U-20 World Cup in his homeland in 1999, he played four games on the road to Korea/Japan and made his World Cup debut against Argentina, with Gabriel Batistuta scoring the deciding goal. He also played a key role in qualification for South Africa 2010, playing nine times as Nigeria reached the finals, only to be eliminated at the group stage once again. Yobo took on the captains’ armband after the retirement of Nwankwo Kanu, and is set to lead Keshi’s men at his third appearance at world football’s showpiece event. "

But he is athletic enough to cover back and control opposing wingers, as he showed at the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations, when he was named to the team of the tournament. He was a vital figure for the Super Eagles en route to their third continental title, and got stronger as the event wore on after being sent off in the opener. \\r\\nAmbrose has gained valuable experience as a member of the Nigerian teams at the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup and at the Olympic Football Tournament in 2008. In his club career, he began at Kaduna United, starting his professional career with the club in 2006. After a loan to Bayelsa United, he returned to Kaduna and helped them gain promotion. He became one of a number of Nigerians playing in Israel when he joined FC Ashdod in 2010, and two years later, he was signed by Scottish giants Celtic.  \\r\\nSince then, he has benefited greatly from playing for a top European club and gaining UEFA Champions League experience. He is rated so highly by club boss Neil Lennon that he was immediately inserted into the Hoops' Champions League line-up just three days after winning the Cup of Nations in February 2013. Ambrose, who continues to be a regular in the Bhoys' starting line-ups, has two league championship medals, as well as a Scottish Cup winner's medal to show for the two years that he has been with the club.

One of the standout Nigerian players in South Africa was defender Kunle Ebenezer Odunlami, and Keshi sang his praises after the tournament. \"He was great. A lot of people didn\\'t know him before now, but I think everyone can see with his performance that we have a lot of talent in the Nigerian league back home.” The Sunshine Star defender in turn said at the time that he hoped that he would still come in contention for a place at the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ finals. “I am happy that people appreciated what I did, especially the coaches.” Odunlami, who can play in central defence or as a right back and first played for the national team in 2013, was selected for Keshi\\'s initial World Cup squad. The 24-year-old started in Nigeria\\'s friendly against Scotland in May, picking up an injury that forced him to be replaced with 15 minutes to go.

He then made Stephen Keshi's squad for the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa, where the west Africans won their third continental title. Following that triumph, he played in Nigeria's first two 2014 FIFA World Cup™ qualifiers but somewhat fell off the radar thereafter, as Keshi gave other players the opportunity of competing at the highest level. Oshaniwa, who is a speedy left back, was close to signing for Celtic at the start of last year and was also keenly followed by Swiss club FC Basel, but in the end stayed with Ashdod. His inclusion in Keshi's extended squad for the World Cup drew some raised eyebrows and the coach, who is known for not shying away from hard decisions, kept Oshaniwa on the bench in the two friendlies (a goalless draw against Mexico and a 2-2 draw against Scotland) the Super Eagles played before the final squads had to be registered.

It was an eye-opening performance by the 23-year-old and Keshi, who was a defender in his time as a player, has been a big fan of Oboabona since taking over the team. Along with goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama, Oboabona was the only player to play every minute in Nigeria's 2014 FIFA World Cup™ qualifiers, as well as the country's FIFA Confederations Cup campaign.   \\r\\n Physically powerful and athletic as well as precocious in terms of positioning and anticipation, he is also capable of playing at right back.

He went on a two-month trial to Anderlecht after the U-17 finals but returned to Nigeria until he was snapped up by another Belgian club, Standard Liege. After the U-20 finals, Chelsea took him under contract, but straight away loaned him out to Dutch club ADO Den Haag to gain some experience, and Omeruo was obviously quick to learn as he featured regularly and received a call up to the Super Eagles side. \\r\\n So impressive were Omeruo\\'s performances in the Dutch Eredivisie that Nigerian coach Stephen Keshi nominated him for the 23-man squad for the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations finals in South Africa.

And it was on the beach that he developed the skills that make him one of the most versatile central defenders in Portuguese football. The footvolley games that he played with his family gave him a tremendous jumping ability. He found this talent only increased when he played on grass, and his strength in the air quickly became one of this determined athlete’s great strengths. Although not especially tall (6’2”), the central defender is fearless when it comes to attacking high balls, both in defence and closer to the opponent’s goal. This characteristic has been a vital part of his success with the Portuguese national team, for whom he is soon to make his second FIFA World Cup™ appearance. Ironically, if Bruno Alves is known for his towering leaps on the pitch, the player built his football career in short, gradual steps. He played for a number of clubs before establishing himself at Porto in 2005/06. His reputation at the club continued to grow, and he was soon named Porto captain.

Fate led him to the island of Madeira, where he played for Maritimo. After a short spell with the club’s B team, he established himself in the first team. It was the first big step towards international stardom, both for Real Madrid and the Portuguese national team. After starring at Maritimo he was signed by Porto in early 2004/05. However the club, which had won the UEFA Champions League the year before, had a season to forget, and Pepe initially struggled. Yet within a year the Brazilian had become the leader of a three man defence created by Dutch coach Co Adriaanse. The system was perfect for Pepe’s speed and tackling ability, and the player was a vital part of Porto’s Primeira Liga title win in 2005/06. The team repeated the feat the following year, and Pepe became an idol to FC Porto’s discerning fans, who were used to watching top class central defenders like Fernando Couto, Jorge Costa and Ricardo Carvalho. The defender’s reputation grew, and in July 2007 he moved to Real Madrid, where it did not take him long to dispel the doubts of fans who questioned whether the defender was worth his €30 million transfer fee. Pepe’s unforgettable summer continued when in August of the same year he was granted Portuguese citizenship, meaning he could be chosen for the national team. Needless to say, it did not take long for Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari to take advantage of the situation and call him up. \\r\\nThe first major tournament in which he played was UEFA EURO 2008, and he was also first choice for Portugal at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™.

Due to his skill and speed he was christened the 'the Figo of Caxinas' in recognition of his similarity to one of the greatest Portuguese players of all time, and a reference to his hometown of Vila do Conde. In 2007/08, Benfica swooped to sign the young left winger, giving him his long-awaited opportunity to prove himself on a bigger stage. But his early days at the Stadium of Light made many observers question whether the player would ever fulfil his undoubted potential. He was given few opportunities in his first two seasons with the Eagles and was eventually loaned to Nacional Madeira, Zaragoza in Spain, and Rio Ave. But Coentrao didn’t give up, and his determination was rewarded when in 2009/10 Benfica coach Jorge Jesus identified him as the solution to the team’s problems at left back.

His excellent performances attracted the attention of the Italian team Siena, where he was voted one of Serie A's most promising new players in the 2012/13 season. One season in Italy was enough to whet the appetite of Russian giants Zenit, where he once again met up with fellow countryman Bruno Alves, alongside whom he would later make his debut in the Portugal defence.

However, after winning the championship with Benfica, the upcoming young players and fierce competition from within the squad led him to seek pastures new. Two seasons at Gil Vicente and three at Sporting Braga provided him with the maturity he needed to return to one of the country´s top teams, which, as fate would have it, turned out to be Benfica´s rivals from the nearby Alvalade Stadium. After moving to Sporting his tigerish style of play soon won over the fans and his regular first-rate performances opened the doors to the Portuguese national side. Manager Paulo Bento handed him his chance during the UEFA EURO 2012 qualifiers and he has not looked back since.  Undisputed first choice at the EURO 2012 finals, where Portugal fell at the semi-final stage, he also held down his place on the right-hand side of the Portuguese defence throughout the qualifying campaign for Brazil 2014.

Even though he seldom played in the qualifiers for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ the strong-willed 23-year-old defender has gained the trust of Fabio Capello and is now a fixture in his squad. His participation in the U-21 European Championship was far from exemplary, clocking up three defeats and a red card in the group phase, but Capello deemed him mature enough to call him up a few months later. He made the last five squads in qualifying for Brazil 2014, but only got on the pitch at the end of the 4-0 thrashing of Luxembourg. In 2014 he again enjoyed playing time, in the friendly against Armenia, showing that he was ready to make the step up. He developed well during his club side CSKA’s sensational 2013/14 campaign as an undisputed starter and was the hero in the semi-final victory in the Russian Cup. Shchennikov will face fierce competition for a starting berth in Brazil, but gaining tournament experience with one eye on the 2018 World Cup is also one of his main goals. "

He would have to wait another three years before finally making his Russian Premier League debut, which came when he signed for Amkar Perm. Though he marked his first appearance with a goal, he played just 21 more matches for the club before moving on to Terek Grozny to help shore up their notoriously leaky defence. The Grozny outfit ended last season in 12th place, narrowly avoiding relegation.  Semenov’s appearance in Russia’s squad for Brazil 2014 has come as something of a surprise. The centre-back was called up to the national side for the first time for the 1-0 friendly defeat of Slovakia in May, a game he watched from the bench, with the first-choice pairing of Aleksei Berezutski and Sergei Ignashevich playing out the entire 90 minutes.

Coates has found his opportunities limited at Liverpool since moving to England, and has so far only featured in two qualifiers for Brazil 2014. He did, however, play in all three of Uruguay's games at the Men's Olympic Football Tournament London 2012, and remains a regular member of Tabarez's senior squad despite picking up some injuries.

Whatever the case may be, the versatile centre-back, who is also able to turn out at full-back or even as a defensive midfielder, is endowed with excellent technique, vast reserves of character and fearsome aerial prowess. Now 27, the player’s Uruguayan top-flight debut came back in 2006 with humble outfit Defensor Sporting, but his big opportunity came after excelling at the South American U-20 Championship in 2007, whereupon he was snapped up by Spain’s Villarreal. Promptly loaned out to fellow La Liga side Recreativo Huelva, Caceres performed so well that, after also featuring in all four of Uruguay’s games at the FIFA U-20 World Cup Canada 2007, Oscar Tabarez soon handed him his senior debut for La Celeste. Selected as part of La Liga’s equipo revelación for 2007/08 and earning a switch to FC Barcelona, Caceres was busy at international level becoming an important component of Uruguay’s backline in 2010 FIFA World Cup™ qualifying. And though he only made two appearances at South Africa 2010, Caceres was a member of the Uruguay squad that won the 2011 Copa America. He then started in four out of five games at the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013, where Uruguay finished fourth, and is rarely overlooked by Tabarez, who used him in ten matches during the Brazil 2014 qualification campaign.

        "DeAndre YEDLIN": "Barely out of his teenage years and only with a handful of caps for USA, DeAndre Yedlin is very much a star in the making and has risen quickly to take his place in Jurgen Klinsmann\\'s 23-man squad bound for Brazil. A fast-moving defender known as much for his maturity and calm at such a tender age as for his wild and ever-changing hairstyles, the player had an instant impact with hometown side Seattle Sounders in Major League Soccer last term. \\r\\nHe was named an MLS all-star in his debut season, the same year he earned his first cap for USA under coach Jurgen Klinsmann. He is most comfortable playing on the right side of defence and his instincts send him zipping forward at every opportunity, not illogical considering he began his career as an out-and-out attacker. \\r\\nExplosive and exciting though he may be, Yedlin’s lack of experience at international level had many in the US media and fan ranks questioning Klinsmann’s decision to include the Sounders’ burgeoning star. “He’s a huge talent,” said the coach. “It will be interesting to see how he takes to this because, obviously, he doesn’t have the experience like other players have.\" "

        "Omar GONZALEZ": "A new face on the USA team, Omar Gonzalez is a physically imposing centre-back who will make opposition strikers think twice about taking him on. Currently the main man in the centre of defence for Major League Soccer giants LA Galaxy, Gonzalez rose to prominence for the Stars and Stripes during the grueling qualifying campaign for the Brazil 2014.  His transition to life as an international centre-half was far from seamless, but coach Jurgen Klinsmann kept faith in his big man at the back and Gonzalez’s education in the exigencies of international football proved fast and thorough. His presence on the pitch offers the US a focal point on attacking set-pieces, with his height and leaping ability a weapon any coach would covet. “I'm good in the air, it's one of my strengths,” he told . “But my best is yet to come.” \\r\\nGonzalez became a hero for his Southern California club when he helped clinch silverware in 2012, earning man of the match honours in MLS Cup, the one-off game that decides the league’s champion. He overcame heavy odds and serious injury en route and has shown the kind of determination that this USA team needs when competing at the highest level. "

The MLS veteran is strong in the tackle, but even better at reading the game and making sure he is in the right place at the right time. Besler was thrown in to the deep end by Jurgen Klinsmann, getting his first national team cap in Mexico City against the United States’ arch-rival to the south, and the defender, to his credit, was spot-on in doing his part to secure a goalless draw on the day. The consistency that might have surprised some USA supporters would have in no way taken Sporting Kansas City supporters unawares. Besler is the defensive rock for a club that prides itself on winning every ball and harrying the opposition into costly mistakes. It was just this kind of assurance in the centre of defence that helped SKC to last year’s MLS league title.  Besler’s only real competitive tournament experience for the Stars and Stripes came last summer when he was called in to take part in Jurgen Klinsmann’s experimental side for the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup. His performance en route to the trophy in that tournament, among unfamiliar teammates, testified to the calm he imparts on a football pitch.  "

Physically and mentally strong, young Brooks makes up for his lack of experience playing in the US and his relatively few number of caps with a cool head and a thorough reading of the game – all evidence of a strong professional club background. He began his club career in Germany with Hertha Berlin while representing the United States at both U-20 and U-23 level. His height and physical presence in the heart of defence led Klinsmann to offer the tall and rangy Brooks his first senior cap in August of 2013 in order to secure his commitment and future to the US cause.\\r\\nBrooks, though still of tender age, offers the Stars and Stripes a refined option in the centre of defence. He is now a first team regular with Hertha and after his first outing in a USA shirt, Klinsmann said of his new find: “It looks like he’s been playing with us for ten years.” High praise indeed. "

        "DaMarcus BEASLEY": "Very few would have predicted a return to FIFA World Cup™ football at this stage in DaMarcus Beasley’s career, and even fewer in his transformed role as a left-back. Beasley’s experience and ability to get forward helped USA coach Jurgen Klinsmann fill a vacant hole in the left side of defence, and it signaled a return to active duty and a fourth World Cup for the speedy winger, whose best days for USA were largely considered to be between 2002 and 2006. \\r\\nPart of a generation of players that also produced Landon Donovan, Beasley’s career in recent years has been defined more by injuries than success at club or international level. He became the youngest player to sign a Major League Soccer contract in 1999 before moving on to play in Scotland with Rangers, the Netherlands with PSV Eindhoven, German side Hannover 96 and now Puebla in Mexico’s top division. \\r\\nEntering his 30s and his second decade in the US national team set-up, Beasley is relishing his surprise renaissance. “He’s is a pure giver,” Klinsmann said of Beasley. “He told me he would play whatever role we asked. He’s tremendous.” Beasley, for his part, is happy to be back in the fold instead of on the outside looking in: “Defending is now what I do for the national team,” he told . “I get more and more comfortable in the role with every game.” "

These qualities have made him a valued asset at Stoke City in the English Premier League, where he has become a regular in the defensive set-up of a side that prides itself on keeping things watertight. \\r\\nBefore his move to England, Cameron was an important member of Houston Dynamo where he was a finalist for MLS’s Rookie of the Year (best young player) award and also its Top Defender gong.

A newcomer to the set-up, he is most comfortable playing on the right but can also line up in the centre of defence if circumstances demand. \\r\\nChandler recently moved back to hometown club Eintracht Frankfurt after taking part in FC Nurnberg's disappointing 2013/14 campaign, one that saw the side relegated from the German Bundesliga. He has had prior stints in the country’s lower leagues.

The central midfielder is one of the game’s thinkers, combining defensive solidity with refined technique, while his intelligence and awareness invariably allow him to make the right decision when it comes to playing passes and moving into space. Gago emerged from the youth set-up at Boca Juniors, making his debut for the club in 2004. His long association with   began a year earlier, Gago appearing in the sides that finished third at the FIFA U-17 World Cup Norway 2003 and won the FIFA U-20 World Cup Netherlands 2005, when he lined up with Sergio Aguero and Lionel Messi. His performances with Boca earned him a move to Real Madrid, where he caught the eye of the then national team coach Alfio Basile, who gave him his first cap in 2007. That same year he played in the first of his two Copas America and went on to win an Olympic gold medal at Beijing 2008 and make 12 appearances in the preliminaries for South Africa 2010, though Diego Maradona decided against taking him to the world finals. Injury dogged Gago during subsequent stays with Roma, Valencia, Velez Sarsfield and on his return to Boca, though he remained in Alejandro Sabella’s plans at all times, playing a total of nine Brazil 2014 qualifiers despite his recurring fitness problems.

Biglia had not yet turned professional with Argentinos Juniors, the club where he received his footballing education, when he skippered his country to third place at the FIFA U-17 World Cup Norway 2003. And he had barely taken his first step in the national top flight when he joined the likes of Lionel Messi and Fernando Gago in taking Argentina to glory at the FIFA U-20 World Cup Netherlands 2005. Independiente was his last stop before a move to Europe, where his displays with Anderlecht persuaded Sergio Batista to draft him into the full national team in February 2011 and to include him in the squad for the Copa America later that year. Though he has not always figured in Sabella’s plans, his excellent form in Belgium, which saw him elevated to the Anderlecht captaincy and score the goal that sealed the 2013 title, earned him a move to Lazio and a recall to the national side.

Named after the great Enzo Francescoli – his dad supports River Plate, where the former Uruguay star is considered a legend – Perez had a lot to live up to. Though he has not quite reached Francescoli’s heights, the 28-year-old has had a solid career since coming through the ranks at Mendoza side Godoy Cruz, where he made his debut as a 17-year-old in the Argentinian second division. In 2007 he made the step up to Estudiantes, where he enjoyed substantial success under Sabella, winning the 2009 Copa Libertadores and the 2010 Apertura title and claiming a runners-up medal at the FIFA Club World Cup. Perez was given his senior Argentina debut by Diego Maradona in 2009. He played once on the road to the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ but did not make the final squad for South Africa. Current  coach Sabella knows the midfielder’s game inside out, even if he barely used him after recalling him to the international set-up midway through qualifying for Brazil 2014.

Rodriguez rose through the ranks at Newell’s Old Boys, where he earned himself the nickname  ('The Beast') after making his senior debut as a 17-year-old in 1998. He moved to Europe three years later and despite persistent knee trouble went on to play for Espanyol, Atletico Madrid and Liverpool before returning to his beloved Newell's.  After his sensational displays for the triumphant hosts at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in his homeland in 2001, Rodriguez became a mainstay in the national set-up. He was an unused substitute as Argentina took gold at the Men's Olympic Football Tournament at Athens 2004, has a runners-up medal from the FIFA Confederations Cup 2005, and has featured in three World Cup qualifying campaigns and at two global showdowns, where he has scored three times in total. Rodriguez did not appear at the Copa America 2011 and was also not included in Alejandro Sabella's first squads as national team coach.

A tireless and incisive central midfielder in his early days at River Plate, Mascherano has developed his game through the course of a career that has taken him to Barcelona, where he has slotted into the centre of defence and won nine titles in four years. \\r\\nFormer Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa had a big hand in getting his career off the ground, taking him to Korea/Japan 2002 as an unused substitute and giving the midfielder his national-team debut a year later, before he had even made an appearance for his club. 2003 proved to be a busy year for Mascherano. Following his long-awaited debut for River, he starred in the Argentina side that finished fourth at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in the UAE and was a first-choice in the  team that finished runners-up at the Copa America in Peru. He helped atone for that disappointment in Athens the following year, winning the first of two Olympic gold medals, a double that no other Argentinian player has achieved. \\r\\nA key figure during Jose Pekerman’s reign,  (The Little Chief) collected a runners-up medal at the FIFA Confederations Cup 2005 and appeared in all five of his country’s matches at Germany 2006.

He bounced back in style representing the Young Socceroos at Netherlands 2005, having been appointed co-captain by Postecoglou, and was also national team skipper of the U-23 team as they successfully qualified for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.  A strong all-round game means Milligan offers value to any team through his versatility. Throughout his career he has played in all positions across the back-line as well as in central midfield. It is in the latter position where he lines up for A-League side Melbourne Victory, and it is here he is likely to feature for the Socceroos. Milligan reads the game well, and is adept with a short passing game, as well an impressive ability to play long raking balls.  Milligan has played for three A-League clubs, as well as stints in China and Japan, but it is at Melbourne Victory over the past two years that he has blossomed. One of Postecoglou’s final acts as Victory coach before taking the national team reins last October was to appoint Milligan team captain.  Milligan is just one of a handful of Socceroos to attend three FIFA World Cups™, although he failed to get on the pitch at either Germany 2006 or South Africa 2010. Milligan was a shock Guus Hiddink selection for the former with the 20-year-old one of only two A-League players included in the 23-man roster.

After two seasons with Brisbane Roar, Oar joined Dutch Eredivisie club FC Utrecht in 2010 along with fellow Australians Adam Sarota and Michael Zullo. Oar soon found his feet in the Netherlands and has been a permanent fixture for the club over the past three seasons. "

        "Oliver BOZANIC": "A busy midfielder capable of playing in an attacking or holding role, Bozanic is highly regarded for his short accurate passing and high tempo movement which makes him a good fit for Ange Postecoglou’s methodology.  Bozanic has long been a candidate for senior national team honours being a former U-17 and U-23 captain, as well as representing the U-20 national team. The gifted left-footer is also the son of one-time Socceroo Vic who played for the national team in 1980.  Like James Holland, Bozanic is a product of the Central Coast region just north of Sydney. His senior career initially commenced in England’s lower leagues with a variety of clubs, where he was on loan from Reading. Faced with limited opportunities, Bozanic returned to Australia in 2010 spending three successful years with Central Coast Mariners. Following the club’s maiden championship win last year Bozanic returned overseas, this time with Switzerland club Luzern. He instantly settled into his stride immediately winning the Swiss league’s Player of the Month award last August, and he has been a first-team regular throughout the most recent campaign.  Though called up for to the Socceroos squad in late 2009, he didn’t make his debut until last October coming off the bench against Canada in what was Holger Osieck’s final match at the helm.  "

        "James TROISI": "A richly talented attacker who seems to be blossoming in confidence, and is now finally making good on years of early promise. Troisi can be used as a wide midfielder or in the forward line, and displays speed of thought and an ability to beat a defender or set a team-mate through on goal with an incisive pass.  Curiously Troisi’s contract is shared by Serie A clubs Atalanta and Juventus, yet he spent the past season on loan at Melbourne Victory. Tellingly he was brought to the Victory by Socceroo boss Ange Postecoglou in one of his final acts at the club prior to assuming the national team reins. It has been a breakthrough campaign in some ways for Troisi, who finished the season as the league’s second top scorer, while also providing the most assists in the league.  Adelaide-born Troisi has enjoyed successful stints at Turkish sides Kayserispor and Genclerbirligi, while he started out at English Premier League side Newcastle United as a raw teenager, though without ever seeing game time at St James’ Park.  Troisi debuted for the Socceroos in 2008 as a 19-year-old and has made infrequent appearances over the past six years. "

        "Mile JEDINAK": "As captain of newly-promoted Crystal Palace, Jedinak became something of a lone beacon in the English Premier League this past season for Socceroo fans accustomed to watching numerous Australians in the English top flight over the past two decades. And Jedinak didn’t let his club or country down with consistent performances in the heart of midfield for the south London side.  He is likely to be one of the first names on Ange Postecoglou’s teamsheet in Brazil, lining up as one of two defensive midfielders. It was Postecoglou that gave Jedinak his first international experience over a decade ago at the 2003 FIFA U-20 World Cup.  Tall and athletically built, Jedinak is not only a tough-tackling midfielder with a venomous shot, but he also boasts strong technical ability and leadership. The Sydneysider may have a thoughtful off-field demeanour, yet he possesses a steely determination to succeed.  Following his time with the Young Socceroos and a season in Croatia – the nation of his parentage – Jedinak spent a season playing semi-professional football in Sydney.  But, perhaps proving his mental fortitude, Jedinak bounced back signing for A-League side Central Coast Mariners where he made an immediate impact, helping the club to an unlikely championship.  Jedinak spent two and half seasons at Turkey’s Genclerbirligi, before making the move to London. Consistent inspirational displays saw Jedinak quickly become a fans' favourite at Selhurst Park, and donning the captain’s armband he led the club back into the Premier League with a thrilling play-off win. 2013 proved a breakthrough year for Jedinak who was named both Palace and Australian player of the year.  Jedinak made his international debut in 2008, and featured at South Africa 2010, playing just once as Australia crashed to a 4-0 defeat against Germany in their tournament opener. He has since firmly established his place in the side, featuring at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup where he scored twice. Jedinak wore the captain’s armband for the first time in March’s international against Ecuador. "

One of the few Socceroos to hail from the Central Coast region just north of Sydney, Holland boasts a high-energy all-round game backed by an eye for goal.  Captain of the Young Socceroos at the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup, Holland struggled to make an impact when he joined Dutch Eredivisie side AZ Alkmaar where he linked up alongside fellow Australian Brett Holman. A loan spell at Sparta Rotterdam was marginally more productive, however Holland’s club career finally came of age three years ago with a move to Austria Vienna. Holland is highly rated by the capital club enjoying regular game time, including in the UEFA Champions League during the most recent season.  Holland made his senior international debut aged just 19 way back in 2008, but it is only over the past two years that he has forced his way back into the national team picture, firstly under Holger Osieck and now Ange Postecoglou.

Most of McKay’s appearances for the Socceroos have been in the troublesome left-back position however he plays his club football in central midfield for Brisbane Roar.  McKay is another player given his international start by Ange Postecoglou at youth level, and he featured for the Young Socceroos at the 2003 FIFA U-20 World Cup alongside Mile Jedinak. Postecoglou also appointed McKay captain at Brisbane where he led the team to the first of the club’s successive championships during the coach’s tenure.  McKay has featured for hometown club Roar since the inception of the A-League in 2005 although he has had brief spells with Korea Republic’s Busan IPark, China’s Changchun Yatai and Scotland’s Rangers.  He plays with seemingly limitless energy providing inspiration to his team-mates in the process, and is also a tidy and efficient passer of the ball making him a perfect fit for any Postecoglou-coached side.

Opportunities remained infrequent as they were during brief loan spells at Duisburg and Arminia Bielefeld. Vidosic returned to the A-League for two seasons with Adelaide United, but last year went back to Europe with Sion, a club which once featured current Socceroos assistant coach Aurelio Vidmar.  Vidosic featured prominently during the U-23s' lengthy qualifying campaign for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but was omitted from the squad which went to China. Vidosic debuted for the Socceroos a year later in the final match of the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ qualifying cycle, and made two further appearances during the Socceroos successful run to Brazil 2014.

With an athletic build Luongo provides a presence in the centre of the park but also looks to be creative and busy around the opposition penalty area.  Sydney-born and raised to an Italian father and Indonesian mother, Luongo unusually missed Australia’s traditional academy-based development pathways and remarkably moved straight from Sydney junior club football to Tottenham Hotspur’s youth team at the age of 18. He played just one League Cup tie for the senior side, before a loan spell at Ipswich Town. He then departed north London last year joining third-tier Swindon Town on a full time basis where he was an ever-present throughout the most recent season.  Having briefly featured for the national U-20 team in 2011, Luongo came off the bench for his senior Australia debut against the Ecuadorians, but failed to get on the park in Australia’s farewell home match against South Africa late last month.

Bresciano is renowned as a ball-playing attacking midfielder with an eye for goal, and his dead-ball delivery has also long been a valuable asset for the national team. Bresciano will likely provide a central option for Postecoglou in Brazil, sitting in front of two deep midfielders in what will surely be his national team swansong.  Having made his national debut at the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, Bresciano is comfortably the longest serving member of the national team squad.  Now 34, Bresciano can look back on a magnificent career for both club and country. He spent 12 years in Italy, including nine seasons in Serie A which concluded in 2011 after a final campaign with Lazio. Much of his club, and indeed international, career mirrored that of great friend and fellow Melbourne native Vince Grella.  Since departing Italy, Bresciano has plied his trade in United Arab Emirates, and now in Qatar with Al Gharafa. However, the most recent season was disrupted by a ban imposed due to club irregularities involving his transfer from UAE to Qatar.  Bresciano has scored numerous crucial goals for Australia, most notably the only goal of the intercontinental play-off against Uruguay in 2005, with the Socceroos eventually prevailing on penalties to break their 32-year FIFA World Cup drought.  Quietly spoken, Bresciano is often somewhat of an unheralded hero for the Socceroos. More recently Bresciano provided the cross for Josh Kennedy to score the winner in the final qualifier against Iraq, which booked Australia’s passage to Brazil.  "

While his versatility enables him to perform anywhere in middle of the park, the position that he occupies most often for  is holding midfielder.  “Witsel has grown into that role. I put him there because he’s got the best tactical brain. He holds onto possession and works for the good of the team. He carries out my ideas on the pitch,” explained the Belgian coach. The Martinique-born midfield man began his career at Standard Liege, where he enjoyed five fruitful seasons, winning two Belgian Pro League titles, a Belgian Cup and two Belgian Super Cups. In 2008, he was named Belgian Footballer of the Year and was capped for his country for the first time. Three campaigns later, he decided to try his luck abroad and signed for Benfica. The combative Belgian did not regret his choice, playing 52 matches and scoring five goals in one season, and attracting the interest of Zenit St. Petersburg in the process. He put pen to paper with the ambitious Russian club in September 2012. "

A versatile midfielder, he has become known for his vision and powerful shooting skills. “In the middle or on the right – Kevin de Bruyne can play anywhere. He’s a very disciplined player. He’s capable of delivering great final balls and upping the tempo of a match,” said Marc Wilmots of the player upon whom  (Red Devils) are sure to lean heavily on in Brazil. \\r\\nHe got his first taste of professional football with Genk, where he made remarkable progress and landed the Belgian Pro League title and Belgian Super Cup in 2011. The young playmaker’s performances earned him rave reviews in his homeland, which in turn led to interest from big-name foreign clubs. It was Chelsea who finally captured his signature, but the London side promptly sent him on a season-long loan to Werder Bremen. De Bruyne enjoyed a productive campaign in the Bundesliga, making 33 league appearances and scoring 10 goals. Upon returning to the Blues in the summer of 2013, he found playing time hard to come by due to the intense competition for places at Stamford Bridge. Consequently, he decided to move on, joining Wolfsburg in January 2014, much to the delight of the club’s loyal fan base. "

        "Marouane FELLAINI": "Everton fans were left scratching their heads when the club broke their transfer record to lure Marouane Fellaini from Standard Liege for close to €20m in 2008. For supporters, the newcomer with the distinctive hairstyle was an unknown quantity, but Everton were convinced they had picked up one of the game's rising talents, and a player capable of tearing around the pitch for 90 minutes applying tackles or finding the net. Fellaini soon proved them right, and as his goal tally grew so too did his reputation. Also on the rise were sightings of afro wigs at Goodison Park, with the Everton faithful keen to pay homage to their new hero. \\r\\nUsed as a holding player during his Standard days, Fellaini has been a model of versatility since moving to England. Often tucked in behind the strikers at Everton, or even positioned up front, the 6'4 midfielder boasts a broad range of qualities, and it was only time before bigger clubs took an interest. The Toffees held them off at first yet they eventually succumbed when Manchester United won his signature last year. Expectations were high on both sides, but Fellaini experienced a testing start to his Old Trafford spell, struggling to find his rhythm in the United midfield. Despite those early issues, he has stuck at his task, convinced he has much to contribute.\\r\\nThe Brussels native has certainly proved that in the past, and not least for Belgium, having won his maiden cap against the Czech Republic back in 2007. He has been an integral player ever since and has served his country with distinction, notably hitting the winning strike against Serbia during 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ qualifying. Fellaini knows how to best apply his skills for the good of the team, and although his focus can sometimes slip, his air of nonchalance is deceptive. 'Big Mo' is never far from the heart of the action, and is usually the first to apply a touch whenever the ball drops out of the air. "

        "Eden HAZARD": "Eden Hazard tends to weave magic wherever he goes, having recently cast England under his spell after first waving his wand in France. Given his professional debut by Lille at 16, he notched his maiden goal almost 12 months later and then claimed back-to-back Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year awards, before following up with two consecutive Player of the Year wins. No footballer had ever made such a scintillating start in the French elite – but, of course, Hazard is no ordinary player. A wizard with the ball at his feet, the outrageously gifted schemer was always likely to outgrow Lille, and he opted to continue his development at Chelsea aged 21.\\r\\nNamed man of the match in his very first outing for the Blues, Hazard set the tone for his Stamford Bridge stay there and then. Reaching the same heights he scaled in France, he has made a habit of changing games single-handedly, and while the goals and assists have flowed, so too has the praise. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho rates Hazard as the best young player on the planet, and Zinedine Zidane believes he fits the profile to slot in seamlessly at Real Madrid. Hazard himself, meanwhile, has voiced the ambition of one day winning the FIFA Ballon d'Or, having dreamt of lifting the trophy since childhood.  \\r\\nHis talent is likewise evident in a Belgium shirt, though the midfielder has struggled to impart the same degree of influence he generates in the club game. First capped in a friendly against Luxembourg at 17, he required three years to plunder his first international goal, eventually opening his account versus Kazakhstan. Soured relations with former coach Georges Leekens did not help, and for a while it seemed that supporters' expectations were weighing too heavily, with the youngster too anxious to do everything himself. Marc Wilmots' appointment ultimately changed the landscape, however, and Hazard has grown in both confidence and effectiveness, as demonstrated by his burst of pace and finish against FYR Macedonia in Brazil 2014 qualifying.

Since that faux pas, Marc Wilmots has continued to include him in his squads, without fielding him in any further qualifiers. However, consistently sparkling performances in warm-up matches for Brazil 2014 have seen the effervescent winger regain the confidence of his national coach.\\r\\nMertens started out at Gent, but it was actually at Dutch second division outfit AGOVV Apeldoorn that he made his name, putting in top-notch displays over the course of three seasons that piqued the interest of top-flight teams. As a result, the Leuven-born wide man moved to Utrecht in 2009, and was later transferred to PSV Eindhoven, with whom he lifted the Dutch Cup and Super Cup in 2012.

The Manchester United winger proved impossible to overlook, however, after a season spent lighting up the English Premier League as one of its brightest new talents. As a result, Januzaj has been making quick introductions to the players he will operate alongside in Brazil, while also getting to know the man pulling the strings. \"He\\'s arriving in a squad whose rules he will have to learn and, above all, respect,\" said Wilmots. \"He\\'s climbing aboard a moving train and I\\'m the one who\\'s driving it.

Rejected by Standard Liege’s youth academy, he even considered giving up football in 2005. He spent two years at MVV Maastricht before he was offered a professional contract by Dutch side AGOVV Apeldoorn, then competing in the second division. Chadli put in a number of strong performances over a three-year period, building a solid reputation in the process. Season 2009/10 saw him score 17 goals for the modest Gelderland club, a feat that brought him to the attention of Twente, the reigning Eredivisie champions. Within a year, the talented midfield man had earned his first cap for Belgium and hit the back of the net in a UEFA Champions League game.

Lyon beat those giants to land the teenager, viewing him as a successor to club legend Juninho Pernambucano, whose No8 jersey Pjanic later inherited. He spent three successful years at the Stade Gerland before moving to Roma for €11m in 2011.

Susic was eligible to represent Belgium and Croatia, but he declared himself interested only in representing Bosnia-Herzegovina and received his first cap in a friendly against Egypt in March 2014, before being summoned by his uncle for the trip to Brazil.

As well as providing a number of assists, the Lazio left-winger also broke the deadlock in the 5-0 win in Latvia.  When he was a child, Lulic’s family fled the Bosnian War and settled in Switzerland, which is where he began his career with FC Chur before moving to Bellinzona, whom he helped gain promotion into the Swiss Super League. Lulic then had spells with established Swiss sides Grashoppers and Young Boys, for whom he netted nine goals in 40 games, before joining Lazio as a 25-year-old in 2011.  Initially expected to be a squad player, Lulic instantly cemented himself into the first-team and enjoyed a fine debut season in Rome, helping I Biancocelesti finish fourth in Serie A. His greatest day in a sky-blue shirt nevertheless came at the end of the 2013/14 season, when he ghosted in at the back post to prod home the only goal against fierce rivals Roma in the Coppa Italia final.

After hitting 16 goals in 23 games for Podgrmec in his homeland, Ibricic was snapped up by NK Zagreb in 2004. After four productive, prolific seasons in the Croatian capital, he made a €1.8m move to national giants Hajduk Split. Ibricic scored 35 times in 76 matches for Hajduk, including in both legs of their triumphant 2010 Croatian Cup final victory.  A cool €7m took Ibricic to Lokmotic Moscow in 2011, but he failed to recreate his form in Croatia and loan spells at Turkish teams Gaziantepspor and KasÄ±mpasa ensued.

The then-forward made his German top flight debut in 2004 but struggled for playing time at Hertha and joined Hoffenheim in 2006.  Converted into a midfielder, Salihovic played a fundamental role in the club’s leap from the third to the first tier of German football. His mix of defensive and offensive play even helped Hoffenheim lead the 2008/09 Bundesliga at its halfway stage, but an injury to his compatriot Vedad Ibisevic was chiefly behind them stumbling home in seventh.  Salihovic performed consistently over the following seasons and augmented his status at Hoffenheim on the final day of 2012/13. Requiring victory away to UEFA Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund to go into a relegation play-off rather than suffer automatic relegation, Salihovic converted two late penalties – both masterfully curled high into the net – to grab Hoffenheim a come-from-behind 2-1 victory. The Sinsheim outfit then beat Kaiserslautern home and away to retain their top-flight status.

After all at the beginning of 2014 it had been two years since the defensive midfielder’s last call up, which came back when Mano Menezes was in charge. What people overlooked was that during this period the player, who first emerged at Atletico Paranaense, moved from Ukrainian Shakhtar Donetsk to English heavyweights Manchester City. And the switch in June 2013 did not just involve changing shirts as, within a short time, he became one of the Citizens' key men.  “So much changed for me during this period, mainly because of my move from the Ukraine to England. I grew a lot on a personal level, and I think that was one of the most important factors in my return to ,” he told . “I have learnt a lot in a short time at City, especially in terms of tactics and technique.” His ability to adapt quickly to his new surroundings certainly caught Luiz Felipe Scolari’s eye.

All that mattered was making sure his team held on to their lead, even if it meant him missing Brazil’s next match, a quarter-final against the Netherlands. Years later, in an interview with , Ramires reflected on that match: “I came off the pitch a happy man after the game against Chile. I played well and set up a goal too. It was my first start in a World Cup match and I never thought at the time it would be my last.” After sitting out  2-1 loss to the Dutch through suspension, Ramires is ready to return to the big stage and set the record straight. Now a well established figure at Chelsea, the pacy, committed and versatile midfielder has been a first choice for every coach that has taken up residence in the Blues dugout in the last four years. Discussing his adaptability in that same interview, he said: “I always try and pay attention to my surroundings when I arrive somewhere and find my feet as quickly as possible. I think I’ve been lucky up to now because I’ve come across a lot of people who’ve made me feel comfortable, though it’s not just down to that.

None of which escaped the attention of Bayern Munich, for whom the player signed in 2011. Given his achievements with the Bavarian giants – before moving to the always ambitious Wolfsburg –, it is only natural that Brazil recognition should follow.

A regular in the Chilean set-up in qualifying, although mainly in a bit-part role, Brazil 2014 will be Silva's first FIFA World Cup™. A product of the Universidad Catolica academy, Silva found his path to the first team blocked in Santiago and only cut his teeth after being farmed out on loan to lower-league Deportes Ovalle in 2005. A further loan spell followed in 2007, this time at Osorno, where his performances during the club's promotion-winning campaign finally earned him a crack at the first team back at his parent club.  After starting out as an understudy to Gary Medel, Silva excelled when he stepped into his sizeable shoes and lifted the title in 2010, though not quite doing enough to force his way into the international picture in time for South Africa 2010. Having won his first senior Chile cap under Marcelo Bielsa in 2011, the midfielder was part of Claudio Borghi's squad at that year's Copa America in Argentina and went on to join Osasuna, initially on loan, in 2012.

He won three trophies under Borghi, as well as reaching the 2006 Copa Sudamericana, and was still a teenager when Nelson Acosta gave him his first senior Chile cap in a friendly against Venezuela. One of the stars of the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada, where several of the current golden crop of senior Chile internationals burst onto the scene, Vidal’s performances earned him a move to Bayer Leverkusen.

However, he shot to fame following a loan switch to top-flight new boys Universidad de Concepcion in 2003, whom he inspired to qualify for the Copa Libertadores. After aborted spells in Spain and Switzerland, Valdivia returned to Colo Colo under Claudio Borghi, swiftly winning the 2006 Apertura. By that time he was a regular in the international picture, having starred as a Chile U-23 side fell at the last hurdle in the Athens 2004 Pre-Olympic Tournament and during the unsuccessful qualifying campaign for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany.  A move to Palmeiras beckoned next, where the tricky schemer was named the best midfielder in Brazil in 2007, but he then grabbed the headlines for all the wrong reasons at that year's Copa America, being hit with a 20-match ban by the Chilean FA for a disciplinary misdemeanour. On the pitch, though, Valdivia continued to dazzle, both in Brazil – where he lifted the 2008 Campeonato Paulista – and following a surprise move to the United Arab Emirates. Indeed, having had his suspension reduced, he was handed an international recall by Marcelo Bielsa and made a key contribution in the latter stages of qualifying for South Africa 2010 and at the tournament proper, where Chile reached the Round of 16. The playmaker, now back at Palmeiras, went to the 2011 Copa America in Argentina, only to be frozen out of Claudio Borghi's side following more off-the-pitch antics. The maverick's rollercoaster ride continued at club level, as the Green and Whites tasted glory in the 2012 Brazilian Cup and then experienced relegation and promotion within the space of 12 months.

Born to a Haitian father and a Chilean mother, the versatile left-sider – he is equally at home as an out-and-out winger or at wingback – has enjoyed a globetrotting career since making his debut for Universidad Catolica in 2002.

The Twente midfielder, who learned his trade at Deportes Temuco and Viña del Mar side Everton before bursting onto the scene at Universidad Catolica aged just 18, had an insider's view of Chile's South Africa 2010 campaign. Gutierrez wasn't a member of Marcelo Bielsa's 23-man squad, but rather one of the lucky youngsters taken along to train with and provide opposition for the first team. Indeed, the skilful, stylish playmaker with a fearsome long-range strike is the only one of those fledglings to have gone on to feature on the road to Brazil. Granted, he only played 21 minutes in qualifying – though that was enough time for him to get on the scoresheet against Argentina – but he was continually called up by Claudio Borghi and then Jorge Sampaoli.  Given such shows of faith, Gutierrez must have something going for him and the versatile 23-year-old has enjoyed success aplenty throughout his budding career.  While still in Chile, the creative midfielder won the title in 2010 and the cup the following year, when he was named breakthrough player of the 2011 Apertura tournament in recognition of his goalscoring exploits and performances in key matches. This big-game temperament helped him adapt seamlessly to life in European football after a 2012 move to Twente, where he has nailed down a place in the starting XI and improved his tactical nous, playing a key role in the club's third-place league finish this past season.

He ended up missing out on a place in the final 23 however, and did not play in any of the qualifiers for Brazil 2014, but did enough in friendlies to earn his spot in the final squad this time around.

It would have been a great loss, as he has developed into a crafty, tigerish midfielder of the highest order, notable for his ability to win and distribute the ball, pick out passes and hit the back of the net. Shortly after this maternal intervention, which came when he was a 16-year-old at Cobreloa, Aranguiz began going places. Following a short loan spell at Cobresal, he returned to his parent club and then moved on to Colo-Colo – where he won the title – and Argentinian side Quilmes. He rose to even greater prominence at Universidad de Chile under a certain Jorge Sampaoli, who personally urged the club to buy 50 per cent of the midfield schemer’s rights from Udinese in 2011. The pair would go on to lift four trophies together. Having made his senior international debut in 2009, Aranguiz failed to make the cut for the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ in South Africa and subsequently found himself in and out of the team under Claudio Borghi, who chiefly deployed him at wing-back. He returned to the engine room following Sampaoli’s appointment as Chile head coach and made seven appearances in qualifying for Brazil 2014, scoring twice. Speaking of Brazil, that is where the dynamo is currently based: he has made waves since joining Porto Alegre side Internacional early in 2014, proving influential in the club’s run to the Rio Grande do Sul State Championship title and picking up the most valuable player award along the way.

A week later, he scored his first goal - beating none other than Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Disappointingly for him, Dusseldorf were relegated at the end of that season, but Bolly decided to remain loyal to the club, and has since fought his way through a frustrating 2.Bundesliga season. "

He first made waves in the high levels of European football with Roda JC, while on loan from Anderlecht at the beginning of the 2007/08 season. He had made his debut at the wealthy Belgian side two seasons earlier, at the age of just 19, but it wasn't until his season with Roda and subsequent move to Twente – where he won the Dutch league in 2010 – that he drew serious notice.  He made the Ivorian squad at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations in 2008 and also caught the eye in all three matches for the Elephants at South Africa 2010. With a move to a larger league on the cards, he moved to Newcastle United, and he has been one of the most consistent performers in his position in the English Premier League.  He has played over 100 league matches for the Magpies, captaining the club on several occasions. The 27-year-old, who turns 28 two days after his side play their second group game against Colombia at the World Cup finals, has been a mainstay for his national team as well, playing in six of the eight qualifying matches en route to Brazil.

Egyptian giants Al Ahly put in a bid to buy Ya, but it was turned down as the  wanted to sell the striker to Europe.  Shortly afterwards, Rosenberg secured his services. He stayed with the Norwegian club for two years before moving to the German Bundesliga, signing for Hannover 96. He has since played well over 100 league matches for the club from the north of Germany, scoring at a return of 39 goals. His arrival in Hannover coincided with a change in fortunes of the club as they secured back-to-back qualifications for the Europa League. Ya, who is a very fast and technically gifted player with an eye for goal, first broke into the Côte d'Ivoire team in 2006, but although he was in the 2008 CAF Africa Cup of Nations squad, he failed to cement a regular place. His performances with Hanover have, however, seen him gain more playing time with his national team and he featured in four 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ qualifying matches. "

The St Etienne midfielder was called up for the Elephant\\'s second leg third round match against Senegal for the suspended Serey Die and Cheick Tiote, but stayed on the bench as the team secured a 1-1 to qualify for their third consecutive finals. But coach Sabri Lamouchi obviously saw enough of the talented youngster to give him a chance to earn his place in the World Cup squad. The 21-year-old Diomande, who can play as both a defensive or attacking midfielder, made his debut in the St Etienne side in early 2012 when he came on as a late substitute against Lille. He played only one other game that season and played just twice the following term. Although he featured in 15 games for his club in the 2013/4 season, the majority of those were as a late substitute, although he enjoyed a spell as a regular between late September and early December. It was during this time that he was called up for the game against Senegal. Diomande first played for the Elephants in the final friendly ahead of the squad announcement, when the West Africans lost 2-1 against Bosnia & Herzegovina."

At the end of the loan period, Leeds United decided to sign Gradel, and he stayed at Elland Road until August 2011 when Ligue 1 team Saint Etienne brought him to France. Gradel has been with the club since then, playing regularly and drawing interest from larger European clubs. While still a Leeds player, the 26-year-old, who is extremely effective coming in off the wing and has an explosive pace and tricky dribbling skills, said that he had joined the club to boost his chances of making the Elephants' squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup™. Although overlooked at the time, he was given a first call-up a few months later and has since been a regular feature in the team and made the squad for both the 2012 and 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations finals.

Like his brother Kolo, Yaya got his first taste of European football at Beveren, a year after starting his professional career at 17 with ASEC Mimosas. He stayed in Belgium for two-and-a-half seasons, quickly becoming a first choice in the starting eleven. Then, in the winter transfer window, he left Beveren for Metalurg Donetsk, where he made regular first-team appearances for another season-and-a-half.  The summer of 2005 brought a further move, this time to Greece. And although his league form with Olympiakos was not outstanding, he conjured up some commanding performances in the Champions League. By the end of the season, he was a target for a number of clubs and finally opted for a move to Monaco. A successful season in France marked by five goals and as many assists in 27 games was followed by a dream transfer to Barcelona, where he spent three seasons before making a big-money move to his current club, Manchester City. Since then, he has cemented his reputation as one of the world's foremost midfielders and will surely be a key player in his team's Brazil 2014 campaign. "

Twice a cup winner with Sion, the defensive midfielder joined Basel midway through the last season. He is known as an aggressive player who does not shy away from hard tackles. His Basel coach Murat Yakin said about him: “He is a player you would rather have in your side than play against.\" That playing style has, though, seen him pick up plenty of red cards, including four in a six-month period.  Serey was a relative late-comer to the national team as he was already 28 when he played his first match for the Elephants.

But it is not only in international football that he has excelled since moving to France and joining SC Bastia at the age of 16. After breaking through into the first team, he was allowed to move to Arsenal for a season on loan and although he did not feature in many games, the Gunners convinced Bastia to sell him to them. Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger decided to switch Song to a new position, slotting him into a holding role in midfield, one in which he could give full expression to his talent, mopping up loose balls and launching attacks from deep. Song repaid Wenger for his confidence with exceptional performances for the Gunners and in seven seasons in England he played 150 Premier League games.

As a battling competitor who also boasts a good motor and technical skills, he makes an excellent link between defence and attack. And despite his relatively small size, his headed goals from set-pieces are another specialty for the athletic player. Makoun was spotted in 1999 during the CAF African U-17 Championship in Guinea by the former Cameroon keeper Joseph-Antoine Bell, who suggested he should try out for some French sides. He signed with Lille and made a name there for many seasons before moving to Lyon in 2008. Despite a strong start to life there, things did not end well after three years and so he moved on to Aston Villa, who sent him on loan to Olympiacos and Rennes. He has since joined the French club on a permanent move and his confidence has grown as he gets regular game time.

The defensive midfielder played 29 league games for Queens Park Rangers, but could not help the club avoid relegation at the end of that season, so he joined Sevilla on loan at the start of last term. A consummate professional, Mbia has not succumbed to the materialism that many players fall for, instead remembering his roots, saying in an interview: “Some footballers might not realise what's going on around them, but there are others like me who know they're privileged and lucky to be living this life.” Mbia played in the FIFA U-17 World Cup Finland 2003 and scored his side's equalising goal four minutes into injury time in their dramatic 5-5 draw against Portugal, where the African side came back from five goals down. He moved on from the U-17s to play for the senior side and also represented his country at the Men's Olympic Football Tournament Beijing 2008.

He scored the equaliser in a 1-1 draw and was named the man of the match. It was to be the start of an ongoing relationship with ambitious Bundesliga club Schalke, who have been impressively consistent in the league and again qualified for the UEFA Champions League this past term. Matip's reputation and value has risen at the same rate, and he is consistently linked with moves to the biggest European clubs.\\r\\nNeedless to say, Matip was a player that the Germans were keen to have for their national youth teams, but the youngster decided that he would rather follow in his brother Marvin's footsteps, who had opted to play for his father's country after earlier representing Germany at the FIFA U-20 World Cup. Joel was included in Paul Le Guen's squad for the CAF Africa Cup of Nations 2010, but he delayed his international debut until a friendly against Italy.

He is also a set-piece expert, provides plenty of assists and knows where the back of the net is, as he showed by finishing third-highest scorer for his side with three goals en route to Brazil. James’s footballing career can only be defined as precocious. His debut in Colombian football came at 14 before he became the youngest foreign debutant and scorer in the Argentinian league at 17. One year later he moved to Europe, where he shone for FC Porto.   James also impressed at both the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2007 and at the U-20 equivalent four years later, where he was one of the outstanding performers in a team that reached the quarter-finals on home soil.

After enduring a tough upbringing and growth problems that almost brought his career to a halt before it had even started, Cuadrado made his debut with Independiente de Medellin in 2008. A year later, at the age of only 21, he made the move to Serie A, and while spells with Udinese and Lecce proved luckless, his arrival at Fiorentina changed everything. He is now rightly regarded as one of   most prized possessions. His first cap for Colombia came in 2010, and since the arrival of Jose Pekerman the midfielder has become a regular fixture in the side, thanks in the main to his explosive ability and versatility, both of which are highly appreciated by the Argentinian.

On his return home, Envigado offered him his first professional contract, and after distinguishing himself at the FIFA U-20 World Cup Netherlands 2005, the young midfielder from Puerto Boyaca packed his bags for Argentina and Boca Juniors. From there he would depart for Europe, enjoying spells with Saint Etienne and Porto, where he won the UEFA Europa League and a host of other trophies alongside compatriot Radamel Falcao, before joining current employers Inter Milan. A creative midfielder, Guarin has excelled wherever he has gone, both in the centre and out on the right. Though blessed with excellent vision and playmaking and passing skills, perhaps his strongest suit is his shooting with either foot. Naturally right-footed, he can strike the ball just as well with his left. First capped in 2006, he took part in the South Africa 2010 preliminaries and gained further experience at the 2011 Copa America before taking on the challenge of helping Colombia return to the world finals for the first time in 16 years.

Two seasons later, Borges made the jump to Swedish side AIK where he continues to ply his trade today.

While Borges has traditionally patrolled the midfield, he is not afraid to get forward into the attack and chip in his fair share of goals.

However, the tenacious defensive midfielder will push other fringe players in the 23-man squad and will certainly jump at any opportunity to help his country compete in what is expected to be a very difficult Group D.

Since making his professional debut in 2011, the 22-year old midfielder has only played for Costa Rican giants Saprissa and has helped the club to several titles in recent years. Though only standing 5ft 9ins, Tejeda comfortably executes his holding defensive midfield duties with composure rare in players his age. While performing admirably for Saprissa both in the youth ranks and now for the first team, Tejeda also made an early splash on the international stage, appearing in the Costa Rican side at the 2009 CONCACAF U-17 Championship and in the U-20 edition of the tournament two years later. Tejeda earned his first senior cap against Cuba after his impressive showing at the CONCACAF U-20 Championship in December 2011. Since then he has served Jorge Luis Pinto well, coming on as substitute on several occasions and even starting an occasional match. Tejeda was almost always on the 18-man roster during qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™, and he made a total of six appearances during the .

        "Diego CALVO": "While he has only been a recent entrant into coach Jorge Luis Pinto’s Costa Rica side, Diego Calvo will be expected to do some of the heavy lifting in  midfield, providing bursts of energy and clever skill on the wings to strike during counter attacks if the central American side is looking to advance out of a tricky Group D at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™.  Having started his professional career at Alajuelense in 2010, where he managed five goals in three seasons for the Costa Rican giants, Calvo impressed quickly and made an impact at the FIFA U-20 World Cup Colombia 2011, featuring in Costa Rica’s three group-stage matches. Calvo now plies his trade in Norway for Valerenga, where he linked up with fellow countryman and team-mate Giancarlo Gonzalez for a short while. He has played predominantly on the left side of midfield, but is equally adept at playing on the right. Impressed by his play in Europe, Pinto called Calvo into his squad during the final round of CONCACAF World Cup qualifying and gave him his cap in a snowy encounter against USA in Denver on 22 March 2013. The midfielder featured another five times for Pinto during qualifying, helping  seal an impressive second place finish just behind the Americans and found his way onto the scoresheet against Jamaica in the process. Though he lacks the international experience some of his team-mates possess, Calvo looks primed to contribute for Costa Rica in Brazil, and could be relied upon heavily by Pinto. "

An Alajuela native, Cubero made his professional debut with Herediano in 2009. The 27-year old midfielder was sent out on a year-long loan to Puntarenas only six months into his time with Herediano, but ever since his return to Costa Rica’s oldest club in July of 2010, Cubero has excelled and signed a three-year extension to stay with the team back in 2013. Though he earned his first cap in 2010, Cubero’s impact in Jorge Luis Pinto’s side only became consistent recently, appearing in nine of Costa Rica’s 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ qualifiers in CONCACAF’s  en route to an impressive second place finish. Cubero will likely serve an invaluable role in coming off the bench to give  an important sense of calm and defensive mentality in the final minutes of a match. "

This summer’s tournament will be the second major competition in which the 25-year-old has featured, following on from UEFA EURO 2012. Despite his young age, Perisic has already played club football in four countries. At the age of 17, he left his hometown side Hadjuk Split for France before moving on to Belgium three years later. He enjoyed his breakthrough season at Club Brugge in 2009/10 and was the league’s leading goalscorer in 2010/11. This success garnered the attention of Borussia Dortmund, who signed the attacking midfielder in 2011. After winning the double in 2012 before facing a more frustrating start to the 2012/13 season, he transferred to fellow Bundesliga challengers VfL Wolfsburg, where he steadily regained his previous form. “He can play in several attacking positions, both on the wing and in the centre,” said his club coach Dieter Hecking in praise of Perisic. His style of play means he is often compared with former German international star Michael Ballack. "

His transfer from Schalke 04 to FC Sevilla in 2011 was a bold but justified move – in the meantime he has been appointed captain of the club and rumours of interest from several of Europe’s biggest clubs persist. Prior to his move to Spain, Rakitic rarely showed his full potential with FC Basel and later Schalke. That has all changed now, however, much to the benefit of his national team. Together with Luka Modric, another gifted playmaker who can change a game in an instant, he forms one of the most impressive midfields on the international scene. Rakitic appeared in ten qualification matches on the road to Brazil 2014 – only four players in the squad managed more. He also played ten times in qualifying for South Africa 2010 and travelled to the 2008 and 2012 UEFA EUROs. With over 60 caps to his name already, he will be one of Croatia’s most experienced players in South America despite his tender years. Born in Mohlin, Rakitic could have played for Switzerland and even represented the  at youth level.

His form leading up to the tournament had been highly impressive as he helped Dinamo Zagreb to a domestic double and since then he has been an integral part of the national side, appearing in 15 FIFA World Cup™ qualification matches since his debut in October 2007. \\r\\nVukojevic left his homeland aged 20 for Belgian club Lierse SK, but returned just a few months later after struggling to establish himself. He developed into a key player with Dinamo Zagreb before his switch to Ukraine, where the 30-year-old won the title in his first season.

In 2008, the midfielder moved from Dinamo Zagreb to English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for around €25m and quickly established himself as an indispensable part of the team. Sir Alex Ferguson, then Manchester United manager, even once described him as the best player in the league. But the diminutive footballing wizard’s journey was not over yet. After four years, he left England behind to join Spanish giants Real Madrid for €35m and, after some initial teething problems, has gone on to secure a starting place in a star-studded team. Modric has played for his country at both the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA EURO 2008 and 2012, having made his international debut against Argentina in March 2006. However, EURO 2008 provided painful memories for the 28-year-old, who provided the assist to give Croatia a 1-0 lead against Turkey in the quarter-final before missing the first penalty in the eventual shoot-out. His current club coach, Carlo Ancelotti, holds his player in the highest regard, saying: “Luka is an exceptional player. I think he’s one of the best midfielders in the world right now, because he can play in more than one position.” "

He faces stiff competition from the likes of Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic and Sammir for a place in central midfield at Brazil 2014, meaning that he will likely be restricted to a substitute’s role. Yet even that will represent a major success for a player with no experience of senior international football. Brozovic plays his club football at Dinamo Zagreb, whom he joined in 2012 on a seven-year contract, following spells at Lokomotiva Zagreb and his hometown outfit Hrvatski Dragovoljac.

However, given the intense competition for places in Croatia’s midfield, the “diamond from Zagreb”, as the country’s media have dubbed him, will not have it easy.

For Jorge Sammir Cruz Campos or ‘Sammir’, however, it will be a truly unique moment. The midfielder was born in April 1987 in Brazil, lived there until he was 19 and spent his teen years at Atletico Mineiro and Atletico Paranaense, also representing his country at youth team level. However, since embarking on a European adventure and joining Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb in 2007, his career has taken a very different path. Sammir quickly established himself as a key player in the Croatian capital, helping Dinamo to a staggering 14 trophies in eight years, and in 2013 he was named the league’s best player before he left the club for pastures new in January 2014, signing for Spanish Primera club Getafe CF. Plying his trade in Europe meant he fell off the Brazilian national team selectors’ radar, but Sammir simply sought a different route to the top. In 2012 he was granted Croatian citizenship and in October of that year he made his full international debut for the  against FYR Macedonia, appearing three times in total as Croatia qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™. The 27-year-old may end up being the team’s super sub in Brazil, since world-class midfielders Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic are likely to start for the team. Nevertheless, Sammir will surely be given a chance to shine in the country of his birth. He has a clever eye for a pass, is composed in possession and an accomplished assist-maker, making him an ideal candidate for a play-making role. He also has an impressive record of scoring goals himself and will be a asset for coach Niko Kovac no matter when he is introduced. "

He made his professional debut at Dinamo Zagreb, grabbing his first senior goals in 2010 at the age of just 16, thereby becoming the youngest goalscorer in the club’s history - though his record was soon surpassed by team-mate Halilovic. Kovacic has also won two league championship medals with Dinamo. \\r\\nIn 2013, he fulfilled the dream of a lifetime by signing for Italian giants Inter Milan. “Inter won many titles when I was still a young boy. It’s unbelievable to be signing for such a great club. I can’t describe my feelings now,” said the young prodigy at the time.

Born in Ambuqui, Ibarra made his debut at El Nacional, where he soon stood out due to his extraordinary technical ability. His impressive performances in Ecuador caught the attention of Dutch side Vitesse and the midfielder is now not only a starter in the Netherlands, but a popular player among the club’s fans as well. His international career began in the youth teams and he was one of the stars of the South American U-20 Championship in 2011, only missing out on a World Cup appearance at that level due to an injury suffered just before the tournament in Colombia.

More success followed at Rubin in the shape of another title and a Russian Supercup, honours that have since earned him a switch to Dinamo Moscow – where he continues to catch the eye. Regarding the national-team set-up, Noboa began at youth level as part of the squad that participated in the U-20 Sudamericano in Colombia in 2005.

The Babahoyo-born attacker has already racked up plenty of miles on his club career trail, starting out at Emelec and then going out on loan to Independiente del Valle – who at the time played in Ecuador’s second tier. A subsequent spell at Mexico’s Dorados followed before returning to Independiente, whereupon he was snapped up by Spanish side Villarreal, for whom he started out in their B team to help the adaptation process.

It was in his next appearance against the Germans, in a FIFA World Cup™ qualifier in Munich in September 2001 that the Liverpudlian underlined his prodigious talent with a typically spectacular first goal for his country. With the sides level at 1-1 approaching half-time, Gerrard unleashed a rocket shot past Oliver Kahn, sending England on their way to a remarkable 5-1 success.  Unfortunately for Gerrard he missed the subsequent 2002 finals through injury so instead had to wait until UEFA EURO 2004 for his first chance to really make his mark on a major tournament. He had captained his country for the first time against Sweden shortly before those finals and in Portugal was an ever present, scoring in a 3-0 group-stage win over Switzerland.  A one-club man, Gerrard resisted Chelsea’s overtures that same summer and was rewarded with arguably the greatest moment of his career in 2004/05, when he played a crucial role in Liverpool’s unlikely UEFA Champions League triumph. It took an explosive, late strike from Gerrard against Olympiacos in December 2004 just to prolong Liverpool’s interest beyond the group stage. Five months later he played a prominent role in a stunning comeback in the Istanbul final against AC Milan, heading the first goal as Liverpool retrieved a 3-0 deficit before prevailing on penalties.

He has earned a number of accolades including the PFA Young Player of the Year award, nomination to the 2010/11 PFA Team of the Year, and Arsenal\\'s Player of the Season award, as voted for by fans for his performances in his first full campaign for Arsenal during the 2010/11 season.  Wilshere missed UEFA EURO 2012 due to injury, but has since returned to play a key role for Roy Hodgson’s side. The midfielder has stated his ambition to captain both Arsenal and England and has been tipped by Arsene Wenger for both roles.  England manager Roy Hodgson said: \"Wilshere has got the personality, the character and the quality to accept responsibility, to accept the pressure. I foresee a fantastic England career for him. Jack has got the qualities [to be England captain], there\\'s no doubt about that.”  "

        "Frank LAMPARD": "Frank Lampard has rightly earned a reputation as one of the world’s finest goalscoring midfielders and one English football’s most consistent performers. He established a record of 164 successive appearances in the Premier League between 2001 and 2005 and is now Chelsea’s all-time leading scorer.  There is no secret to Lampard’s success. He owes his fitness levels to years of hard work that began in boyhood, when his father, former West Ham United defender Frank Lampard Sr. taught him the habit of extra running sessions, or ‘spikes’, each day to improve his speed and stamina.  It was with West Ham that Lampard began his professional career, under the tutelage of his uncle Harry Redknapp, then manager of the east London club. After 187 appearances at Upton Park, he joined Chelsea in June 2001.  Lampard had made his England debut in 1999 but it was not until the 2003/04 campaign that he truly found his feet on the international stage. The Londoner began that season with his first goal for his country in a friendly win over Croatia and he ended it with three in four games at UEFA EURO 2004, where England reached the quarter-finals.  At 26, he was entering his prime. He hit 19 goals for Chelsea in 2004/05 to help them to their first English title for half a century and ended 2005 second only to Ronaldinho in the vote for FIFA World Player of the Year. A further Premier League success followed in 2005/06.  Lampard played for England at South Africa 2010 famously 'scoring' a goal against Germany that clearly crossed the line but was not awarded. That season he had helped Chelsea to an FA Cup and Premier League 'double' and since then he has continued to star for the Blues, guiding them to FA Cup and UEFA Champions League success in 2012. However, he was ruled out of EURO 2012 with a thigh injury.  On 10 September 2013, he became only the third English player to reach his 100th England cap in a FIFA World Cup™ qualifier with Ukraine.

In the build-up to the Finals, Jordan made his England senior team debut against France at Wembley in November 2010, playing alongside Steven Gerrard from the start. That partnership was soon replicated at club level with the midfielder joining Liverpool from Sunderland shortly before the UEFA U-21 EUROs in Denmark.  Henderson was named as a standby player in Roy Hodgson's UEFA EURO 2012 squad and came into the squad following an injury to Frank Lampard. He featured in two games: against France and Italy both as a substitute.  On 3 February 2013, Henderson was named the England U-21 Player of the Year in the inaugural year of the award. He also captained the U-21 side at the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship.  In November 2013, he played for England for the first time since Euro 2012 with substitute appearances in friendly matches against Chile and Germany. He made his second start for the national team in a 1–0 defeat of Denmark on 5 March 2014.  "

His continued good form for the Saints alerted the interest of Arsenal and he joined the Gunners in the summer of 2011 having already been fast-tracked into Stuart Pearce’s U-21 squad by that stage.  Nicknamed ‘The Ox’, derived from the first part of his surname, as well as his physical tenacity and powerful playing style, Oxlade-Chamberlain is the youngest English goalscorer in UEFA Champions League history.  He made his debut for the senior England side on 26 May 2012 in a 1–0 win against Norway in a friendly. Following this, he received a surprise call-up to the England squad for UEFA EURO 2012, becoming the second youngest player ever to represent England in the European Championships behind Wayne Rooney when he started in England's opening game against France.  Oxlade-Chamberlain scored his first senior international goal, in a 5-0 victory over San Marino in October 2012. He scored again in the return match against San Marino in March last year, which England won 8-0. He also scored against Brazil in the official opening of the refurbished Maracana in a 2-2 draw.

He made 48 appearances for the Yorkshire club before moving to Newcastle United in July 2004 and Aston Villa for a fee of £12m four years later. It was at Villa where he made his senior debut for England, coming on as a substitute for Ashley Young in a friendly against the Netherlands in Amsterdam in 2009.  Prior to his full debut, Milner had represented England at U-16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and U-21 levels, appearing in UEFA European U-21 Championship finals. The midfielder also holds the record number of appearances (46) with England’s U-21 side.  After impressing Fabio Capello, Milner was included in the Three Lions’ squad for South Africa 2010, setting up the only goal of the game in their win over Slovenia. Milner also played in six matches during qualifying for UEFA EURO 2012, and was named in Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad for the tournament.  After that FIFA World Cup™, Manchester City reportedly paid £28.5m for his services and he has completed the domestic treble of winning the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup at the Etihad Stadium.

He helped John Peacock's Young Lions to qualify for the European Championship Finals in Serbia, where England reached the semi-final and then took part in the FIFA U-17 World Cup in Mexico in the summer of 2011, where he netted a stunning goal against Rwanda.  Sterling continued to develop at Anfield and was called up to the England U-19 squad by Noel Blake at the start of the 2012/13 campaign, following some impressive early season performances in the Liverpool first-team.  Less than a week after his debut for the U-19s against Germany in September 2012, he was propelled into the senior squad by Roy Hodgson for the match against Ukraine at Wembley as a replacement for Theo Walcott.  With more appearances for Liverpool under his belt, Hodgson gave Sterling a full England debut in November 2012 when he started against Sweden in Stockholm and he has remained on the radar ever since, whilst still impressing with his performances for Gareth Southgate's U-21 side.

He was brought into the squad to face Ukraine in a FIFA World Cup™ qualifier at Wembley following the withdrawal of a number of players from the initial squad.  Lallana won his first cap for England on 15 November in a friendly match against Chile at Wembley Stadium and claimed his first assist in the March friendly against Denmark when he set up the only goal of the game for Daniel Sturridge.

That is not a status he has particularly revelled in, given his shy nature off the pitch. Once he enters the field of play, however, Iniesta is able to leave those inhibitions behind and unleash an astonishing talent for finding eye-of-the-needle passes, evading even the tightest of markers and testing a goalkeeper’s reflexes from any angle.  Though not a prolific goalscorer, he has shown a knack for popping up with crucial strikes, such as the aforementioned one in Johannesburg, for both club and country.

Until that point, the midfielder had mostly made headlines for different reasons, with his move from Le Havre to Manchester United aged 16 stirring up controversy and his switch to Turin three years later also provoking a raft of comments. Far from a problem player, however, Pogba tends to specialise in providing solutions. \\r\\nPhysically imposing at 6\\'3 tall and blessed with sublime technique, sharp vision and a powerful shot, Pogba is a magisterial presence in midfield. His extraordinary potential caught the eye from a young age, and it is no coincidence that he captained France at U-17, U-18, U-19 and U-20 level. As his first coach, Gael Mahe, explained: \"Pogba is an exceptional talent, with huge physical and mental strength, and a rare level of technique that serves his inspired way of playing. His consistency, patience and application will take him to the top of the game.\" Indeed, the youngster left United due to frustration with his limited playing time, feeling that he was being overlooked solely due to inexperience. \\r\\nWith Andrea Pirlo, Claudio Marchisio and Arturo Vidal holding down the midfield spots at , Pogba also began on the bench after moving to Italy in 2012, but he still managed to contest 27 Serie A games in his debut season. Since then, coach Antonio Conte has found it increasingly difficult to leave him out, especially as the Franco-Guinean – whose brothers have opted to represent Guinea – collected the adidas Golden Ball as France won the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup. By that point, Pogba had already earned his senior cap in March 2013, and he is now one of Didier Deschamps\\'s most trusted lieutenants. "

        "Morgan SCHNEIDERLIN": "Morgan Schneiderlin is without a doubt the most unexpected name to feature on France’s 23-man list, even though the hard-working midfielder was regularly involved with his country’s youth teams between 2004 and 2010. After coming through the ranks at Strasbourg, he experienced just one Ligue 1 campaign prior to joining Southampton, then playing in England’s second tier, in 2008.  Over the course of four seasons in the lower divisions, the young Frenchman earned the respect of fans and opponents alike, his tenacious, tough-tackling approach belying his slender build.  In the autumn of 2012, he got his first taste of the Premier League, where he rapidly found his feet, scoring his first top-flight goal on 2 September 2012 against Manchester United. At the end of season 2012/13, he was named Southampton's Player of the Year.  Unfamiliar to the vast majority of football fans in France, Schneiderlin, who had originally been included in Didier Deschamps’ provisional 30-man squad, was called up as a late replacement for the injured Clement Grenier.

        "Sami KHEDIRA": "In a Germany team that has grabbed headlines for its free-flowing attacking style in recent years, Sami Khedira’s tireless running, defensive expertise and on-field leadership have been crucial to adding steel to the creative talent in the side. The holding midfielder has long been a mainstay in Joachim Low’s preferred starting line-up, which is why news that the Real Madrid star has recovered from a cruciate ligament injury sustained last November and been declared fit in time for the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ has been met with a loud chorus of approval.  \\r\\nEven from an early age it was clear that Khedira, who has a Tunisian father and a German mother, possessed the qualities to succeed at the very top. At the age of eight he joined the renowned Stuttgart academy and won two German youth championships with the Swabians prior to turning professional. He repeated the feat in his debut Bundesliga season in 2006/07, before captaining the Germany U-21 side to the European Championship title in 2009. Khedira, whose younger brother Rani now plays for Stuttgart, moved to Madrid in summer 2010 and went on to win the Spanish league title and the Copa del Rey in subsequent seasons.  \\r\\nKhedira did not need long to establish himself in the Germany set-up but it was at South Africa 2010 that he truly cemented his place in the first team, crowning a series of superb displays at the tournament with the winning goal in the match for third place against Uruguay.  The midfielder, a model professional both on and off the pitch, was among Germany’s best players at UEFA EURO 2012 and started every game as the side swept into the semi-finals, where they were eliminated by Italy. In Brazil he will be aiming to add to an already impressive collection of silverware. "

The Bayern Munich midfielder is the lynchpin of Joachim Low’s Germany side and, after recent successes at club level - including lifting the UEFA Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup trophies - he has his sights set on winning silverware on the biggest stage of them all.\\r\\nA one-club man, having joined Bayern as a 14-year-old, Schweinsteiger was deployed as a right winger at the start of his professional career in 2002, but the Upper Bavarian native is at his best in central midfield where he can dictate the pace of matches. Schweinsteiger’s constant availability to receive a pass, coupled with his reading of the game and top-class technique have made him the perfect link between defence and attack both for Bayern and Germany. Once affectionately known as “Schweini” as a younger player, he has since developed into a true on-field leader who sets the tone for others to follow.\\r\\nSchweinsteiger, who was named as Germany’s Player of the Year in 2013, has amassed over 100 international caps and will not turn 30 until a few weeks after the conclusion of Brazil 2014. He truly became a global household name at the 2006 finals in his homeland, thanks to his brace against Portugal to earn Germany third place. Four years later he was one of the pillars of the national team that again ended up with the bronze medal, a track record that has given him added incentive to do better in Brazil. "

His technique, intelligence and ability to bring the ball under control even while running at top speed have made him one of the most feared attacking midfielders in the world, while he also has a clinical eye for goal and can carve open opposition defences with inch-perfect passes. Born in Gelsenkirchen to Turkish parents, Ozil joined FC Schalke from Rot-Weiss Essen as a 16-year-old and went on to make his Bundesliga debut for the Royal Blues a year later. In January 2008, the left-footed playmaker moved to Werder Bremen but it was not until 2009 that his major breakthrough came, when he fired the north German club to glory in the DFB Cup, as well as winning the U-21 European Championship with Germany in Sweden and later establishing himself as a key member of Joachim Low’s senior side. \\r\\nOzil was in the starting line-up for all seven of his country’s matches at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™, repeatedly demonstrating his outstanding ability as one of Germany’s best players at the tournament. The team finished in third place and Ozil’s talent caught the eye of Real Madrid, where he subsequently played for the next three seasons, winning the Spanish league title and the Copa del Rey.

After finishing in third place at the two most recent FIFA World Cups™, Germany 2006 and South Africa 2010, the 30-year-old is determined to finally lift the world\\'s most coveted Trophy at Brazil 2014. Lahm has long been considered one of the finest players in world football thanks to his unruffled composure in possession and skill at reading the game. Those qualities, combined with his outstanding technique, tireless energy and tackling ability have also made him one of the most dangerous full-backs around. Having started out as a left-back, Lahm opted to switch flanks before Pep Guardiola converted him into a defensive midfielder, a change Joachim Low has also frequently adopted in the national side. Aside from a two-year stint with Stuttgart at the beginning of his professional career, the Munich native has played for Bayern since he was 11 and has been a pillar of the Germany team since 2004. In the opening game at Germany 2006, Lahm became a firm fan favourite by breaking the deadlock against Costa Rica in Munich with a stunning strike into the top corner from the edge of area. Four years later he was named as Michael Ballack\\'s successor as captain. It remains to be seen what kind of impact Lahm and the Germany side will have in Brazil, but their objective is to be in the Final at the Maracana: \"I hope I\\'ll be playing football on 13 July,\" Lahm told FIFA.com in an exclusive interview a few months ago."

He is a regular both in Pep Guardiola’s star-stacked side and in the national team under coach Joachim Low. \\r\\nRaised in Greifswald, a town lying on the Baltic Sea, Kroos was part of the Hansa Rostock youth academy for four years before he moved to Bayern as a 16-year-old. Just a year later he helped Germany to a third-placed finish at the FIFA U-17 World Cup Korea 2007, where he won the adidas Golden Ball as the tournament’s best player. Kroos made his Bundesliga debut shortly afterwards, before being sent on an 18-month loan to Bayer Leverkusen at the end of 2009 in order to gain more match practice. Upon his return to Munich, Kroos has since won every title available, including the UEFA Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup. \\r\\nKroos was part of the Germany squads at both the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ and UEFA EURO 2012, but it was not until Brazil 2014 qualifying that he truly cemented his place in the side, scoring three goals in seven appearances.

Boasting stamina rivalled by few others in the Bundesliga, the 23-year-old made a central midfield berth his own at Borussia Monchengladbach in 2013/14 and emerged as a star in his own right. Even after regular Germany midfielders Ilkay Gundogan and Lars Bender were ruled out of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ with injury, few expected Kramer to somehow play himself into contention for the final 23-man squad. The Solinger-born man proved the doubters wrong, however, earning plaudits from all angles and fighting his way on to the plane to Brazil. A youth team player at Bayer 04 Leverkusen and Fortuna Dusseldorf, he signed his first professional contract at Leverkusen in 2010. Despite appearing for Germany’s U-19 and U-20 sides, he struggled for first-team action at his club, and in 2011 he decided to move to Bundesliga 2 club VfL Bochum on loan. It was from there that his career took off, as he established himself as one of the second tier’s standout players and Germany’s hottest prospects. At the beginning of the 2013/14 campaign he extended his deal with Leverkusen, simultaneously agreeing a loan move to traditional powerhouses Monchengladbach. He missed just one game all season as the Foals qualified for the UEFA Europa League, and was rewarded with his senior international debut in a 0-0 friendly draw with Poland on 13 May. "

Essien missed out on South Africa 2010 with a cruel knee injury and is looking to Brazil 2014 to banish those memories. Even in the twilight of his career, Essien, who played for Ghana at Germany 2006, is still a dangerous and inspirational figure.\\r\\nEssien began his European career with an unsuccessful trial at Manchester United. He may not have earned a contract, but he did famously leave Old Trafford with David Beckham’s autograph. Idling for several months in his agent’s flat in Monaco, Essien eventually signed with Bastia in France and three seasons later he moved to Lyon, where he won successive Ligue 1 titles in 2004 and 2005 and was voted the league’s best player. A big-money transfer to English Premier League outfit Chelsea catapulted Essien into the international limelight and he spent the next nine seasons with the Londoners before moving on loan to Real Madrid. He returned to Chelsea at the start of the 2013/14 campaign but struggled to make an impact before moving to AC Milan. Essien’s trophy cabinet is filled with Premier League titles, FA Cup triumphs and even the UEFA Champions League. Despite not playing in the final when Chelsea beat Bayern Munich, the defender’s place as an immortal Ghanaian legend is safe enough. "

Karagounis’s finest hour, and indeed his country’s finest footballing moment, came during EURO 2004. The midfielder opened the scoring at the tournament with a low drive from distance against hosts Portugal. There was personal heartbreak for the-then Inter Milan midfielder, as he picked up an 87th-minute booking in the semi-final against Czech Republic which ruled him out of the final, also against the hosts. Rehhagel’s troops had enough without their midfield general though, and saw off Portugal to claim their maiden tournament triumph at full international level. Since then, Karagounis has gone on to become Greece’s most-capped player, overtaking Theo Zagorakis with his 121st international appearance in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ qualifier against Bosnia-Herzegovina in October 2012. He played ten matches on the road to Brazil, with six of those coming from the bench. Despite the waning number of starts for the 37-year-old, his influence is still huge in the Greek camp and Fernando Santos, who worked with the midfielder at Benfica, clearly holds him in high regard due to the sureness the veteran exudes. “We have confidence and know we can beat any opponent,” Karagounis said during World Cup qualifying.

        "Lazaros CHRISTODOULOPOULOS": "Despite making his debut back in 2008, Lazaros Christodoulopoulos has had to wait for his opportunity in the Greece side, having missed out on consecutive tournaments at UEFA EURO 2008, the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™ and EURO 2012. The languid winger with a vicious long-range drive has forged a formidable reputation since moving to Serie A side Bologna in early 2013. He exploded on to the scene in Italy, grabbing a goal on his debut against Fiorentina after coming on as a substitute. He has gone on to establish himself as a key component of squad since joining from Panathinaikos, where he picked up a Greek league and cup double in 2010. Fernando Santos has taken on board the impact Christodoulopoulos has had at club level and played him in every qualifying group game after he grabbed the winner against Lithuania in Vilnius. The Bologna man was on the bench for the play-off games against Romania, but his place in the finals squad gives Santos some much-needed flair to unpick the Colombian, Japanese and Ivorian defences.

The steely midfielder also featured in the Greeks' failed attempt to defend their continental crown in 2008. He played in all three group games at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™ and played a part in his country’s first victory in the competition, laying on the pass for Dimitrios Salpingidis’s winner against Nigeria. Katsouranis’s career began back in 1996 with Panachaiki, based in his home city of Patras, helping them to promotion to the Greek top flight before departing for AEK Athens in 2002. He was named Greece’s Player of the Year in 2005 and continued to impress the following year when AEK finished league runners-up to claim a place in the UEFA Champions League. It was at that point that Katsouranis decided to follow AEK coach - his now national team boss - Fernando Santos to Benfica. Salpingidis was named the club’s Player of the Year in 2009, when he also added a Portuguese cup triumph to his roll of honour. He then moved back Greece to join Panathinaikos, the club he had supported all his life. He picked up a Greek Super League and cup double to his trophy cabinet before joining current side PAOK in December 2012. The reliable Katsouranis featured heavily in Greece’s journey to Brazil, often captaining the side in the absence of Giorgios Karagounis. It was only suspension that prevented the No21 from featuring more often, as he picked up several yellow cards during qualifying as well as being dismissed against Latvia. The veteran midfielder turns 35 during this summer’s tournament and his experience is key to Greece achieving their goals. "

The midfielder made a substitute appearance in the final group qualifier against Liechtenstein and rose from the bench in the two play-off matches against Romania. A determined player who has flourished under the stewardship of former Spain midfielder Michel at Olympiacos, Samaris began his career at Panachaiki before earning a move to Panionis in the Greek Super League. His impressive performances in the centre of the park for the  caught the attention of perennial Greek champions Olympiacos, who signed him on a permanent deal in 2012, before loaning him back for the duration of the 2012/13 campaign to the Nea Smyrni Stadium. Since his return to Olympiacos, Samaris has formed a crucial part of the  midfield, playing every minute of the UEFA Champions League group stages which saw his side emerge to face Manchester United, and elimination, in the knockout stages. The tall midfield man picked up the first silverware of his career as Olympiacos confirmed their 41st league title in March. "

        "Panagiotis TACHTSIDIS": "Defensive midfielder Panagiotis Tachtsidis has found it difficult to dislodge the old guard in the centre of the park for Greece, but his technique and Italian footballing pedigree means he is one for the future for Fernando Santos. Making his full national team debut aged 21, a few months after UEFA EURO 2012, Tachtsidis played just 67 minutes in qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™, but was named in eight of the 12 squads on Greece’s road there.  His club career has seen him rack up eight clubs at the age of just 23. The left-footed midfielder started his career at AEK Athens, making his Greek Super League debut aged 16 alongside Brazilian legend Rivaldo. At 18, he appeared in the UEFA Europa League for the  and made his move to Italian football with Genoa the following year. Tachtsidis has since become something of a journeyman of the Italian game, with mixed loan spells at Cesena and Grosseto followed by a successful loan at Verona, who narrowly missed out on promotion to Serie A at the end of the 2011/12 season. That spell impressed giants Roma sufficiently to sign the midfielder permanently from Genoa. As part of the complicated co-ownership deal, he returned to Genoa in 2013 before signing for current side Catania, who in turn loaned him to Torino in January. "

        "Wilson PALACIOS": "Wilson Palacios belongs among a select group of players with the ability to change the course of a game on his own. Known as ('The Magician') because of his ability on the ball, Palacios is the kind of central midfielder every coach would like in his side.\\r\\nPalacios' professional career began at Victoria in 2000 but just a year later he joined Olimpia, one of Honduras' most historic clubs. The stocky midfielder's knack of scoring goals and providing assists, coupled with his gift for long-range shooting, earned him a call-up to the national side and he made his international debut in a friendly against Paraguay in 2003. \\r\\nHis talents did not go unnoticed further afield and Palacios has plied his trade in England ever since Birmingham City secured his signature in 2007. He was a pillar of the Honduran side during 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™ qualification and was instrumental in helping end the country's 28-year absence at the finals. At that tournament, he and his brothers Jerry and Johnny gave Honduras the curious honour of becoming the first nation to compete at a World Cup with a trio of siblings in their squad. On the books at Stoke City for the last three seasons, Palacios played 838 minutes spread across 11 matches for Honduras en route to Brazil 2014 and would have appeared more often but for a series of injuries.

The forward's biggest asset is his strapping frame, which enables him to bounce off defenders and makes him an ideal foil for Honduras strike partner and namesake Jerry Bengtson. The 32-year-old earned his first international call-up for a friendly against USA just a year into his career. However, he has been in and out of the picture since then and was only a last-minute inclusion in the squad for South Africa 2010, where he and siblings Johnny and Wilson made history as the first trio of brothers to represent a single country at the same FIFA World Cup™. Having signed for Chinese outfit Hangzhou Greentown in January that year, 2010 also marked the beginning of the marksman's international adventure at club level. He spent one year there and another at Hunan Billows before returning home in 2012, rejoining former club Marathon and then moving on to Platense. However, Palacios seemingly possesses itchy feet to go along with his powerful legs and the industrious forward goes into Brazil 2014 on the back of his debut season in Costa Rica with Alajuelense. "

He was called up to the national team for the first time later that year and scored on his debut against El Salvador. \\r\\nHowever, his career did not pan out as planned on the Old Continent and he returned to Real Espana later in 2010.

The son of a professional footballer, Garcia's middle name, Boniek, is a tribute to the Juventus and Poland legend Zbigniew. Though lacking the goalscoring touch (but not the stamina) of the 1980s star, the technically gifted midfield dynamo is an extremely useful player in his own right, serving as a creative heartbeat in the middle of the park. Garcia made his name domestically at Olimpia, for whom he enjoyed two stints either side of a short spell at Marathon. He received his first international call-up for a 2005 friendly against Canada and subsequently established himself as a regular in the squad, although – as already noted – he did not make it onto the pitch at South Africa 2010. After failing to earn a deal during a trial in France, in 2012 the midfield schemer joined Houston Dynamo, where he has been a revelation. So good has Garcia's form been at club level that he has forced himself into the starting line-up for Honduras, for whom he played 13 times in qualifying for Brazil 2014.  "

Espinoza also featured at the Men’s Olympic Football Tournament at London 2012, where he found the net against Brazil.   \\r\\nHis eye-catching displays there paved the way for his move to the English Premier League with Wigan the following year.

Despite his tender years, the 21-year-old Honduran international has already amassed a fair amount of big-game experience, including featuring at the 2012 Olympic Games in London and in the latter stages of qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™. What the pint-sized attacking midfielder lacks in height, he more than makes up for with his blistering pace, which enables him to burst past opposition players at will. Coupled with natural flair, this readiness to take on defenders makes the youngster a potentially consistent match-winner, offering an extra dimension to Honduras going forward and able to lead the charge on the counter-attack. Having moved to the USA with his family at the age of 13, Najar signed for DC United in 2010, going on to open his goalscoring account not long after. Some three years and 82 appearances later, the starlet was Europe-bound after agreeing a deal to join Belgian giants Anderlecht. Najar became a full international in 2011, winning his first cap in a friendly against Colombia, and has gone on to nail down his place in Luis Suarez's squad.

The diminutive defensive midfielder is deceptively quick and is highly effective at breaking up opposition attacks, although some of his best performances have come when fielded on the left, from where he cuts inside onto his stronger right foot to instigate attacks with his pinpoint passing. \\r\\nGarrido made his senior debut at club level for Juticalpa in 2007 and after a string of consistently good displays he moved to Olimpia at the end of the season. After initially struggling to break into the first team he joined Deportivo Savio on loan, but returned in 2011 having gained more experience and he has since established himself at Olimpia, one of the country's biggest clubs. \\r\\nNational team coach Luis Fernando Suarez selected Garrido for international duty for the first time in 2012 and he has been involved ever since.

The next year saw him figure in his first AFC Champions League during which Sepahan finished as runners-up, but as winners Urawa Red Diamonds had also won that year's J.League, the Iranians were fortunately granted a place at the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup.

That, allied with his consistent performances with the national team, saw him inherit the captain’s armband from the talismanic Mehdi Mahdavikia in 2009.  Deployed as a central midfielder, Nekounam plays a key role in both Iran’s defence and attack. Aside from dealing with rival offences, he has always been at the centre of Iran’s more positive intentions, with his tally of 37 international goals making him the current squad’s top marksman.   While steering Iran to their fourth global appearance, Nekounam maintained no-less-impressive form during ’s qualifying for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.

With his international debut not coming until August 2005 in a friendly against Libya – after Iran had secured a place at Germany 2006, Timotian surprised even his own supporters by making it into Branko Ivankovic’s World Cup squad. Aside from showcasing his talents on the global stage, the midfielder cut an emotional figure as Iran crashed out with a 1-1 draw against Angola in the closing group match. After the final whistle he collapsed on the turf, sobbing wildly and being comforted by coaches – a poignant scene which made him a national hero in the eyes of Iranian fans. Eight years have elapsed but the ex-Bolton Wanderers and Fulham man's aspirations for success have yet to diminish.

Included in a preliminary squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup™, he eventually missed the cut for South Africa along with Fabio Grosso. \\r\\nThree years after taking his international bow, Candreva was selected by Cesare Prandelli for the Brazil 2014 qualifier against Armenia on 12 October 2012, which Italy won 3-1.

A proud product of the Juventus youth system, he captained Italy at every youth level, with his innate gifts becoming apparent at a young age. Above all, his stamina, close control and powerful long-range shooting allow him to excel anywhere in midfield, while his vision and intelligence set him apart from his peers. Marchisio made his Juventus debut under Didier Deschamps in 2006 as the club sought, and eventually sealed, a return to Serie A. With all the talent at 's disposal, however, it would be some time before he could hold down a regular starting berth. His persistence paid off, and in August 2009, aged 23, he made his senior Italy debut under Marcello Lippi. Nevertheless, it was after Antonio Conte and Cesare Prandelli took charge of Juventus and Italy respectively that his career really began to soar. In the wake of 's disappointing 2010 World Cup bid, Marchisio was the only player along with Gianluigi Buffon and Andrea Pirlo to contest every minute for Italy at UEFA EURO 2012, and he was involved again at the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013.

        "Alberto AQUILANI": "A technically gifted midfielder who likes to play in the hole, Alberto Aquilani is a product of the Roma training academy, where he started out at the age of 15. Thanks to his finesse on the ball and ability to shoot from distance, he quickly got himself noticed. As well as making his way at Roma he also broke into Italy’s youth set-up, distinguishing himself at the 2003 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, where he won the Golden Player Award. Right from his debut in Serie A, Aquilani earned rave reviews for his sublime technique and shooting skills. He was at the top of his game in November 2006, when he had the misfortune of suffering a serious knee injury that sidelined him for six months. Only a week before, he had made his full international debut in a 1-1 friendly draw with Turkey. He took part in Italy’s UEFA EURO 2008 campaign but was left out of Marcello Lippi’s 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ at the last minute. Invited back into the fold by Cesare Prandelli, he started all five of Italy’s games at last year’s FIFA Confederations Cup.   "

A proficient holding midfielder who protects the defence with aplomb, he is also quick to try his luck from distance whenever the chance arises – qualities which have helped him contest over 300 games for . The perfect foil to Roma ace Francesco Totti, he also shares his club-mate's burning will to win and the character to match. A European champion with the Italian U-21s in 2004, De Rossi also won bronze at the 2004 Men's Olympic Football Tournament in Athens. He was promoted to full international duty in a qualifier for the 2006 FIFA World Cup™ against Norway just a few months later, contributing a debut goal in a 2-1 victory. On 30 March the following year, and still only 21, he then donned the captain's armband for the first time in the second half of a 0-0 friendly draw with Iceland. Germany 2006 proved to be an up-and-down affair for De Rossi. Sent off just 26 minutes into the group match against USA, he received a four-match suspension, only making his return in the second half of the Final against France – but, crucially, converting his penalty in the shoot-out. Like his team-mates, he was then unable to shine in South Africa four years later, but that did not dent his reputation in the eyes of incoming coach Cesare Prandelli. A versatile performer capable of playing in almost every position, he has settled into the role of defensive midfielder. Nothing short of a pillar for Italy, he was voted Italian Sportsman of the Year in 2010 and was included in the Team of the Tournament at UEFA EURO 2012. During the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil, he notched his 15th international goal against Japan, thereby surpassing the great Gianni Rivera to become ’s highest scoring midfielder.    "

First taught the ropes at Como, he made his first-team debut with the Lombardy outfit in the third division but had to leave after the club went bankrupt. Parolo then spent several seasons passing from one club to the next without being given time to demonstrate his true ability. \\r\\nHe eventually found stability at Cesena, where coach Pierpaolo Bisoli brought him under his wing in 2009. The switch was a success, and on 29 March 2011 Parolo made his Italy debut in a 2-0 friendly win against Ukraine, coming off the bench in place of Claudio Marchisio. Cesena's relegation from the top flight hindered his progress, but he signed for Parma in 2012 and Cesare Prandelli proved he had not forgotten the midfielder when he called him up again for the 2-2 draw against Nigeria on 18 November last year. Winning his second cap, Parolo came on for Thiago Motta. "

        "Andrea PIRLO": "The years have clearly not yet taken their toll on Andrea Pirlo, who remains Italy\\'s imperious midfield maestro. As comfortable playing just in front of the defence as he is carrying out more advanced duties, he is completely two-footed, endowed with fantastic vision and an unparalleled passer of the ball. If that were not enough, he is also a remarkable free-kick taker. It was Carlo Ancelotti who suggested he operate in a more withdrawn role while the duo were at AC Milan in 2002, and Pirlo quickly settled into his new duties alongside midfield comrades Gennaro Gattuso and Clarence Seedorf. This tactical masterstroke brought  great success, while Pirlo – dubbed \"a Zico in front of the defence\" by former Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira – became practically irreplaceable. In the space of nine years at Milan, the Italy stalwart secured two UEFA Champions League titles, a FIFA Club World Cup, a pair of Serie A crowns, two UEFA Super Cups and an Italian Cup Pirlo made his  debut at the age of 23 in 2002, but he had to wait two more years until the second fixture of UEFA EURO 2004 before establishing himself as a starter. Nicknamed  (Tinkerbell) or (the Architect) by his team-mates, he then enjoyed his greatest triumph at the 2006 FIFA World Cup™, where he was voted Man of the Match in the duels with Ghana, hosts Germany and Final opponents France. Two years later, he contested three group games at EURO 2008, while injury kept his involvement in Italy\\'s 2010 World Cup debacle to a minimum. Soon after taking the reins, Cesare Prandelli made Pirlo his vice-captain behind Gianluigi Buffon, and the midfielder paid him back by performing superbly at EURO 2012, picking up three further Man of the Match awards in six outings. Pirlo then celebrated another landmark achievement by collecting his 100 cap during the FIFA Confederations Cup on 16 June last year.   "

        "Marco VERRATTI": "Still only 21, Marco Verratti already looks to possess the finest attributes of two Italian legends, combining Andrea Pirlo's vision and ability to dictate a game with Gennaro Gattuso's drive, commitment and thirst for victory. Originally from Pescara, Verratti turned professional with his local club at 16, following eight years spent in the youth set-up. Just 5'5 tall but extremely dynamic, he was originally fielded as a  – a playmaker sitting behind the centre-forward – but that all changed when Zdenek Zeman took over the helm for the 2011/12 campaign. The then teenager was repositioned in front of the defence to better organise the team's play, and he soon won praise for his rapid ball distribution and capacity to vary Pescara's routes to goal. Verratti's influence grew as the season unfolded and he helped steer the club to promotion from Serie B, in the process earning himself the nickname 'The Pirlo of Abruzzo'. Subsequently lured to Paris Saint-Germain by Carlo Ancelotti, he quickly secured a starting spot in a line-up brimming with star names, and it was only a matter of time before Italy came calling. A maiden cap swiftly followed on 15 August 2012, when Verratti featured in a 2-1 friendly loss to England at the age of 19.  "

        "Yasuhito ENDO": "For more than a decade, midfielder Yasuhito Endo has been a mainstay of the Japanese national team, where his creativity, precise passing and unerring free-kicks have been major weapons. Japan’s most-capped player, Endo has spent his entire career in the J.League – a rarity these days for top-class Japanese players.  Endo made his professional debut for Yokohama Flugels (now Yokohama F. Marinos) in 1998, the year Japan played in its first FIFA World Cup™. After a stint with Kyoto Sanga, he joined Gamba Osaka in 2001, where he still plays and remains a fan favourite. Endo guided Gamba to its maiden AFC Champions League title in 2008, and his impressive performance in a 5-3 loss against Manchester United in the FIFA Club World Cup that year even earned praise from manager Sir Alex Ferguson. \\r\\nGamba were demoted to the second division for the first time in 2012, but significantly Endo stayed and helped the club bounce back the following campaign. Although originally a defensive midfielder, the 34-year-old showed his versatility last season by even playing up front at times.  Born in Kagoshima Prefecture, Endo is the youngest (and most successful) of three brothers who played football. As he steadily progressed through the national team ranks, he helped Japan reach the semi-finals of the 1999 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Nigeria, and played at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Perhaps the biggest disappointment of his career, however, was the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Despite being selected in the squad by coach Zico, Endo was not granted any playing time. Determined to make amends for this setback, the midfielder worked even harder to polish his game.  His conscientious work paid off at South Africa 2010, where he scored a trademark free-kick against Denmark in the group stage that helped the Samurai Blue reach the Round of 16.  "

        "Toshihiro AOYAMA": "A midfield anchorman with Sanfrecce Hiroshima, Toshihiro Aoyama won many plaudits in helping his side to consecutive J.League titles in 2012 and 2013. His exquisite passing skills and knack of being in the right place at the right time have made him an influential player who can shut down opposition forwards and then quickly turn defence into attack.  Aoyama has spent his entire professional career with Sanfrecce, where the football of choice is a fluid passing game. Since 2006, he has been used as a deep-lying midfielder in a role reminiscent of Italian midfield general Andrea Pirlo.  The 28-year-old has overcome several major setbacks during his career. A broken leg wrecked his 2007 season, during which Hiroshima was relegated to the second division. He was a central figure in qualifying for the 2008 Beijing Olympics but was omitted from the tournament squad, and another serious injury curtailed his 2009 season. Nevertheless, Aoyama continued to produce reliable performances and has been integral to Sanfrecce’s success in recent years.  The hard-working defensive midfielder made his international debut against China PR at the 2013 East Asian Cup, and his penchant for making interceptions and his accurate passing could be vital if he gets on the field in Brazil.

A product of the Cerezo Osaka youth programme, where he was so highly regarded that he was often named team captain, Yamaguchi initially struggled to get game time after breaking into the senior team. However, since 2011, the 23-year-old has become a key player at the J.League club.  Yamaguchi gained further recognition when he appeared in every minute of Japan’s campaign at the 2012 London Olympics, where they narrowly missed out on a medal. His sterling performances were a major factor in his side reaching the semi-finals for the first time in 44 years and firmly established him as the leading Japanese holding midfielder of his generation. Yamaguchi was one of several young players called up by coach Alberto Zaccheroni for the East Asian Cup in July 2013, and he repaid the faith shown in him by being selected as the tournament’s most valuable player as Japan were crowned champions.  Despite his obvious qualities, Yamaguchi is not guaranteed a starting position at the FIFA World Cup™ in Brazil.

Hasebe was originally deployed in a playmaking role, at times just behind the front two, at his first club, Urawa Red Diamonds. His sublime dribbling skills and precision passing, along with a knack of popping up in attack, have since made Hasebe a fixture with the Samurai Blue.  Although Hasebe contributed to Urawa picking up domestic silverware and also winning the AFC Champions League in 2007, he missed out on selection for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany™. In 2008, he was signed by German club Wolfsburg, where he operated primarily as a holding midfielder, but also occasionally as a defender and wide midfielder. In his second season, Wolfsburg won the Bundesliga title, with Hasebe frequently in the thick of the action.  The player’s growing list of achievements soon became impossible for then Japan coach Takeshi Okada to ignore. Hasebe became a regular in the national side and was appointed captain for South Africa 2010. There the midfield linchpin ushered Japan through a tough group containing the Netherlands, Denmark and Cameroon, and his inspiring efforts at this tournament saw him become the face of the Japanese team.  Hasebe has retained the armband under coach Alberto Zaccheroni and is integral to Japan’s chances in Brazil.

Few have ever questioned the ability of a player who has been operating at the top level in Europe for over a decade, starring for Ajax, Hamburg, Manchester City – where he cost £18 million – and, most recently, AC Milan. At 29, De Jong also has plenty of first-rate football ahead of him.  There have, though, been question marks over his discipline, with Van Marwijk famously suspending him from international duty after a typically fierce tackle while in action for City resulted in a leg-break for Hatem Ben Arfa. \"I have a problem,” the then coach said, “with the way Nigel needlessly looks to push the limit.\"  However, critics of the midfielder’s aggressive style of play often overlook the fact that, in his entire career, he has been red-carded only once – and that was almost eight years ago, and for a second yellow card. At his best, De Jong remains one of the finest defensive midfielders in the game and could yet prove as influential for the in 2014 as he was at South Africa 2010.  "

        "Jonathan DE GUZMAN": "Born and raised in Scarborough, Ontario, Jonathan de Guzman was widely expected to follow his older brother, Julian, by declaring his allegiance to his native Canada. Instead, and having joined Feyenoord’s youth system at the tender age of 12, he opted for the Netherlands after gaining Dutch citizenship in 2008.  Opportunities to impress have been few and far between in the years since, but De Guzman did feature in the  2008 Olympic squad and has recently returned to the fold under Louis van Gaal. Three appearances during the team’s qualifying campaign hardly mark him out as a regular, but the Villarreal midfielder – currently on loan at Swansea City – is among several staking a claim for greater involvement.  He has certainly made his mark in Wales, where his form over the past two seasons has helped cement Swansea’s place in the English Premier League and secure the first major trophy of the club’s history. Spectacular free-kicks continue to prove a speciality, while De Guzman’s overall play has shown indications that he is rediscovering the sparkle that made him such a sought-after talent during his time with Feyenoord and Real Mallorca.

        "Wesley SNEIJDER": "No player picked up more Man of the Match awards at the last FIFA World Cup™ than Wesley Sneijder, adjudged the best player on show in four of the Netherlands’ seven matches. Nor were those the only awards with which he returned from South Africa, with a runners-up medal accompanied by the adidas Silver Ball and Bronze Boot, reflecting his status as the tournament’s second-best player and third-highest scorer.  Sneijder would also find himself on FIFA’s Team of the Year, and named UEFA’s best midfielder of 2010, and deserved no less for his performances in a truly extraordinary year for club and country. After all, while he fell just short of World Cup glory with the Netherlands, Sneijder picked up a collection of winner’s medals for Inter Milan, most notably the coveted UEFA Champions League.  It was the culmination of the midfielder’s increasingly spectacular rise from the precocious youngster first glimpsed in the famous red-and-white of Ajax at the age of 18. After establishing himself with the Amsterdam giants, winning seven trophies and earning a place in the national team, Sneijder departed for Real Madrid in 2007 for €27 million – making him the second-most expensive Dutchman in history.  This gifted playmaker impressed at times in Madrid, but a new wave of arrivals prompted to offload him to Inter for €15 million in 2009 – and how they would regret that decision. Sneijder went on to confirm his status as one of the finest midfielders in the world and, while his career has stalled a little since 2010 – with exile at Inter and a not entirely successful move to Galatasaray – the respect he holds among his team-mates is evident.  Indeed, when Louis van Gaal implied that he might not select the midfielder for Brazil 2014 due to his unconvincing club form, Arjen Robben’s response was unequivocal. \"When he plays at his own level and is fully match fit, which he is now, Wesley is a player who brings something extra,” said the Bayern Munich winger. “You need that at a World Cup. Wesley is an extraordinary player when he\\'s at his best and we have to take advantage of that. He still adds something to the .\"  "

Likened to both Xavi and Andrea Pirlo for his range of passing and ability to play with his head up, coolly assessing his options, the 22-year-old is already being linked with some of the top clubs in Europe.  Like Xavi, he is small and not particularly strong, but his sharp turns and use of the ball have established him as a regular for Feyenoord and won the admiration of Louis van Gaal. The Netherlands coach was impressed by Clasie’s performances for the U-21s and called him into the senior squad, giving him his debut in a FIFA World Cup qualifier against Turkey that the Dutch won 2-0.  That was the first of five preliminary matches in which the youngster featured, and at no stage did he look out of place amid the household names elsewhere in the Dutch team. The tenacity he blends with his passing ability was evident for all to see, and Clasie will need to show that same side of his armoury as he attempts to win a place in Van Gaal’s starting XI.  "

Now 24, the former Feyenoord and Twente midfielder has just completed his first full season in England’s Premier League, becoming a fixture in the Norwich City line-up.  Indeed, while Norwich have struggled, the club’s former manager Chris Hughton declared himself “delighted” by the way in which Fer had made the transition from the less fast-and-furious Eredivisie. Nor has Hughton been the only manager impressed, with Liverpool’s Brendan Rodgers said to be considering a summer bid, and Louis van Gaal having called on Fer several times since taking charge of the Netherlands.  Though not a regular in the national team, the big midfielder played in three of the FIFA World Cup™ qualifiers and is an option to provide the solidity required for the more expressive midfielders to strut their stuff. Fer is a product of the Dutch youth ranks, and a former captain of the national U-17 side, although it was only in 2009 that he finally declared his allegiances, having spoken openly of the temptation to turn out for his parents’ home country of Netherlands Antilles.

Opportunities have proved scarce in the time since, though, and the attacking midfielder failed to make a single appearance during the Oranje’s FIFA World Cup™ qualifying campaign.  Wijnaldum, though, is a player who has been tipped for stardom ever since moving to Feyenoord in 2007 and becoming the club’s youngest-ever player, debuting in April of that year at the age of 16 years and 148 days. The youngster continued to impress across a variety of attacking midfield roles, and in 2011 PSV Eindhoven paid €5 million to prise him from Rotterdam.  Wijnaldum has been a regular in the PSV side ever since, and though not always hitting the heights expected earlier in his career, he remains a potent attacking weapon. Pace, technical ability and a willingness to run at defenders will certainly make him an exciting player to watch should Van Gaal utilise his abilities during the World Cup.  "

A true left-footed wide option in a team full of forwards and attacking midfielders, he has the potential to offer some instant offence or an introduction of width against a difficult to break down opponent.   An experienced veteran of the Nigeria Premier League, Uzoenyi joined his compatriot Onyekachi Apam at French club Rennes on loan after the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations, but did not have time to make much impact during the second-half of this season. Although he made only one substitute appearance at the AFCON, the former Enyimba and Enugu Rangers player had done enough in Keshi’s sides to draw attention from a variety of European clubs. He is most natural on the left side of midfield but can also be deployed on the right side if needed. "

A tall and strong figure in the middle of the park, Gabriel joined Kilmarnock soon afterwards, but did not feature in many games for the Scottish Premier League club before a fall-out over the role he was playing. After a trial with Tottenham Hotspur, he signed for Belgian club Waasaland-Beveren. Again his first team opportunities have been sporadic as injuries ruled him out of action.   Gabriel played his first game for Nigeria in 2010 and scored his first goal for the Super Eagles two years later when he opened the scoring in a 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ qualifier against Malawi – a game that ended in a 1-1 draw. He also played another game in Nigeria's qualifying campaign as the west Africans secured a second consecutive appearance on football's greatest footballing stage.

The only player at the tournament considered better than the Flying Eagles midfielder was a certain Lionel Messi.  Mikel was described in the tournament\\'s official report as an outstanding player with good vision, who can dictate pace and launch his side\\'s attacks. Fast-forward nine years, and the authors have been proven right, even though Mikel is asked to do far less for his star-studded club side Chelsea than he is with Nigeria, where he has long been thought of as having the potential to change the national team\\'s fortunes.\\r\\nIn fact, despite an up-and-down history with the Super Eagles, Mikel has been a key inspiration behind Nigeria\\'s resurgence under coach Stephen Keshi. He was a cool but driving presence in Nigeria\\'s midfield as they won their third CAF Africa Cup of Nations last year, finally fulfilling all of his promise as an all-action midfielder that could not only stop opponents, but create chances quickly in the other direction.  In 2010, a knee injury forced Mikel out of Nigeria\\'s 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™ squad, so he is particularly eager to perform well in Brazil and showcase his talents. Mikel has won just about everything there is to win with Chelsea, including the Premier League, the FA Cup, the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Champions League.

Two years later he played at the U-20 World Cup in Colombia as Nigeria advanced to the quarter-finals, where they were knocked out by France. At that stage, Azeez was already playing his club football in Spain, with UD Almeria. Azeez was born in the Nigerian capital of Abuja and came through the ranks at the Future Pro Academy, before agreeing to join the Spanish club in 2010. The transfer took nearly a year to be completed, but he finally moved to Europe in July 2011 and started playing for the Almeria B side that was competing in the Segunda Division B.  After learning the ropes in the reserve side for two seasons he was promoted to the first team at the start of the 2013/4 season and featured in 30 league matches. He scored two goals, both of which proved to be match-winners, during the season in which the club escaped relegation on the last day of the league.

He joined Lazio in 2011 and impressed to such an extent that he has featured regularly in the clubs' Serie A matches. He also stood out during Nigeria’s CAF Africa Cup of Nations triumph last year, playing a versatile role alongside Jon Obi Mikel that allowed the Super Eagles ample attacking thrust to keep moving forward.\\r\\nDespite being tipped as one of Nigeria's biggest emerging stars, Onazi failed to get any playing time at last year's FIFA Confederations Cup.

At 13 he switched to Lisbon rivals Sporting, and it was when he was wearing the green and white that Veloso made his mark.  His senior debut for Sporting came at the start of 2006/07 and it did not take long for his exceptional talent and a magical left foot to turn heads, putting in a man-of-the-match performance in a UEFA Champions League match against Inter Milan in the same season.

After watching him play for minnows Clube Mira Sintra, Benfica tried to sign him, but William was from a family of Sporting supporters so he preferred to bide his time and wait for the green and whites to come calling. And so they did. Aurelio Pereira, the scout who had brought talents such as Luis Figo, Simao Sabrosa, Nani and Cristiano Ronaldo to the Alvalade, presented the club with a new diamond.  In contrast to his illustrious predecessors, it is not on the wings that William shines, and speed is not his number one asset. An imposing physical presence, William is a brilliant holding midfielder, showing calmness and maturity beyond his 22 years.  After a year and a half on loan at Belgian outfit Cercle Brugge, he was a surprise inclusion in Sporting’s first-team squad ahead of the 2013/14 season, but after a handful of matches nobody doubted his ability.

The next season he was an undisputed starter for Sporting, showing what would become trademark features of his game: metronomic consistency and a tireless engine. Moutinho played every minute of the 2005/06 league campaign, and would repeat the feat in subsequent seasons, never playing fewer than 35 games a year.   At 19 he was named a vice-captain of Sporting and one year later he took over the captain's armband, thereby becoming a symbol of the Lisbon club.

At the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ he could forge a central-midfield partnership with Bayern’s Xherdan Shaqiri, although he may face stiff competition for a starting spot from Eintracht Frankfurt’s Pirmin Schwegler.

In July 2008 Behrami signed for English side West Ham United, only to move back to Italy in January 2011 when Fiorentina came calling. Despite being handed a contract there until 2015, Behrami transferred to Napoli in July 2012.\\r\\nBehrami earned his first international cap in October 2005 in a 2006 FIFA World Cup™ qualifier against France and has been a mainstay in the Switzerland squad ever since.

His first taste of international football with Uruguay was a frustrating one, as the side failed to qualify for the FIFA U-20 World Cup 2003. However, later that same year Juan Ramon Carrasco did hand him a maiden cap with senior side. Everything seemed to be going to plan when new coach Jorge Fossati took him to the Copa America in 2004. Yet after playing in just two of his country's 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany™ qualifiers, he fell out of favour with Fossati.  Oscar Tabarez recalled him to the national set-up at the start of 2007. By the time Porto secured his signature, Rodriguez was a cornerstone of Uruguay’s efforts to reach South Africa 2010. However, he paid the price for his tenacity in the final qualifying game, earning a two-match ban which led to his exclusion from the tournament squad.  Nevertheless, Tabarez never lost faith in Rodriguez and the midfielder added the 2011 Copa America trophy to the ten titles earned with Porto.

The Paysandu native made his debut with Nacional aged just 18 and made waves in 2009 with some sensational displays. His four goals were instrumental in his side reaching the semi-finals of the Copa Libertadores and he also helped Uruguay qualify for the FIFA U-20 World Cup Egypt 2009. He capped dazzling performances at that competition with winning the league title in 2008/09, inevitably catching the eye of national team coach Oscar Tabarez. Although Lodeiro did not feature at all during the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™ qualifying campaign, he started both play-off matches against Costa Rica. That helped earn him a place in Uruguay’s squad for the tournament, where he appeared three times as a substitute. After the World Cup, he went to play for Ajax in the Netherlands, where he won three titles. Lodeiro was given a similar role by Tabarez at the Copa America 2011, although he did start one match during the tournament. However, a year later at the Men’s Olympic Football Tournament the midfielder was given a starting berth in all three games, and a year later, in two of the five games at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil.

He had not yet made his senior debut for the club when Victor Pua called him up for the country’s FIFA U-20 World Cup Nigeria 1999 qualifying campaign.

However, Perez was largely peripheral during 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan™ qualifying and was not included for the play-off against Australia or at the tournament proper. Jorge Fossati brought Perez back into the national set-up in 2004 and named him in the squad for the continental championships in Peru that year, as well as fielding him in the ultimately unsuccessful qualifying campaign to reach Germany 2006. It was therefore no surprise that Oscar Tabarez selected Perez at the start of his tenure. He was a first-team regular in his third Copa America as well as during South Africa 2010 qualifying. Perez played in all seven of Uruguay’s matches at that FIFA World Cup and appeared in five out of six matches at the 2011 edition of the South American championship, where he won the first title of his career. At 33, Tabarez still fully trusts in Perez, who played an important role in Uruguay’s fourth-place finish at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil, where he saw action in three matches, and in their Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign, where he played in ten, all of them as a starter.

That milestone appearance came shortly after helping Uruguay qualify for the FIFA U-20 World Cup Egypt 2009, a tournament he started three of his country's five games at.  Ramirez scored six goals en route to winning the Uruguayan league title in 2009/10, an achievement that did not go unnoticed by national coach Oscar Tabarez.

The ambitions of the rising North African star were then dealt a severe blow by a knee injury that sidelined him for most of the 2009/10 season, towards the end of which he signed for Valencia. After recuperating and enjoying a short loan spell with Almeria, Feghouli would, over the next three years, become one of the stars of ’s starting XI, putting in top-notch displays in La Liga, the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. It did not take long for the Algerian international set-up to take an interest in the cultured playmaker, and he received his first cap for  in a CAF Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Gambia in February 2012, a match in which he also scored his first international goal. Voted Algerian Footballer of the Year in 2012, the beguiling No10 appeared in three matches at the 2013 Cup of Nations in South Africa. During the recent qualifying campaign for Brazil 2014, he played seven times, hitting the net on three occasions. "

The forward topped the scoring charts for his side during qualifying, hitting five goals in seven games. After starting out in the youth ranks at Ain Benian, Slimani began his senior career with third-division Cheraga, for whom he struck 18 times in 20 matches. His prowess in front of goal persuaded Belouizdad to bring him on board in May 2009, and Slimani went on to spend four seasons with the club, helping them reach the Algerian Cup final in 2012. The Algiers native first earned international recognition when he was called up by Abdelhak Benchikha for Algeria's B squad, and although he was not given playing time, his breakthrough was not long in coming. Slimani proved his worth in the qualifiers for Brazil 2014 and tied down a starting spot at the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations, where he contested all three of Algeria's games without finding the net.  Now firmly established in his country's starting line-up, the striker continued his progress by signing for Sporting Lisbon last summer, marking his first season in Portugal by plundering a number of important goals.

Those efforts helped Chlef clinch the league title, and Soudani also weighed in with three strikes as Algeria finished fourth at the 2011 CAF African Nations Championship. The striker began his career with Chlef at the age of 19 in 2006, and two years later he was voted the best young talent in the Algerian top flight. After catching the eye at the African Nations Championship, he then agreed a deal to join Vitoria Guimaraes, lifting the Portuguese Cup in 2013 during his two-year stay. Soudani left Guimaraes for Dinamo Zagreb last summer, helping the club win the Croatian Super Cup soon after his arrival. He quickly proved his worth for his new side, contributing a number of important goals on domestic duty and in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Champions League. On the international stage, Soudani's excellent displays for Algeria's B team earned him a senior call-up in June 2011 to face Morocco. He represented his country at the 2013 CAF Africa Cup of Nations, finding the net against Côte d'Ivoire, and he continued his progress during qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™, notching important strikes against Rwanda and Mali.

Indeed, the attacking midfielder’s skilful displays have earned him the nickname ‘The Algerian Messi’ over the past few years. Following an initial season with his home-town club, ES Setif, he embarked on loan stints at El Eulma and at El Harrach. Upon returning to Setif, the talented playmaker lifted the Algerian Cup – a competition in which he finished top scorer – and was named Algerian Footballer of the Year for the 2011/12 campaign. In the summer of 2012, he committed himself to Tunisian giants Club Africain, with whom he topped the league scoring charts. Djabou gained his first taste of international football with Algeria at the CAF African Nations Championship in 2011, where the Desert Foxes reached the semi-finals.

Born in 1991, the pacy wide man began his career with Quimper before moving to Le Havre, where he signed his first professional terms. He then made his debut for the Normandy outfit's first team against Angers in July 2011. After making 34 French Ligue 2 appearances for Le Havre during the 2012/13 campaign, the 23-year-old opted for a taste of English football, joining Leicester at the start of the year.

        "Gonzalo HIGUAIN": "How would Gonzalo Higuain's career have panned out had he accepted then France coach Raymond Domenech's invitation to feature in a friendly for Les Bleus back in 2006? There is no way of knowing, but one thing we do know for sure is that the France-born forward – who always dreamed of playing for Argentina – would have scored goals whoever he represented.\\r\\nThough his father, Jorge Nicolas Higuain, was a footballer, Gonzalo is far from a chip off the old block. While dad was an uncompromising defender nicknamed Pipa (The Pipe) because of his prominent nose, Pipita (Little Pipe) is a fox in the box – a natural No9 who relies on his pace and sharp instincts to always be in the right place at the right time. He can set up goals as well as finish with both feet and his head.\\r\\nHiguain enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top, moving to Real Madrid as a teenager, just 35 appearances and 13 goals after making his River Plate debut in 2005. Following a short teething period, his class soon came to the fore, allowing him to hold his own amid competition from the likes of Raul, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Rafael van der Vaart and Karim Benzema. He lifted six trophies in Madrid – his most prolific season came in 2009/10, when he hit the target 29 times in 40 games – and has continued to bang in the goals since joining Napoli in 2013.\\r\\nHaving not represented Argentina at youth level, the sharpshooter had to bide his time before making the international breakthrough. Overlooked for the 2007 Copa America and that year's FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada, he finally got a call-up in 2009, though he previously turned out for the U-23 side. Diego Maradona handed him his first cap in a 2010 FIFA World CupTM qualifier against Peru and he duly got on the scoresheet. Higuain started all five games in South Africa, netting four times during Argentina's run to the quarter-finals. He has been a fixture in the team under current coach Alejandro Sabella, finishing as the country's second top scorer on the road to Brazil 2014 with nine goals. As such, Sabella will be banking on the Napoli predator and his deadly partnership with Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero to fire the to the trophy this summer. "

        "Lionel MESSI": "Such has been the praise that Lionel Messi has attracted during the course of his stellar career that there is not much more that can be said about him. Reflecting on that problem, his current national team coach Alejandro Sabella said: “It’s got to the stage where you have to invent a new adjective for him.”  \\r\\nBlessed with eagle-eyed vision, sublime technique and lightning acceleration, the left-footed wizard patrols the area in and around the box, detecting defensive chinks that are invisible to mere mortals. His gift for shifting through the gears, skipping past opponents and finding the back of the net, both from open play and dead-ball situations, has brought him so many goals that it is easier to list the records he has yet to break than the ones that have already fallen to him. \\r\\nThe story of his early days has become the stuff of legend. Born in Rosario, he played for Newell’s Old Boys’ youth teams before moving to Spain at the age of 13 and earning a trial with Barcelona. “I spotted him straightaway,” said Carles Rexach, the head of the  youth set-up at the time. “As a symbolic gesture, I made him sign for the club on the back of a napkin.” \\r\\nNicknamed  (The Flea) on account of his slight frame, Messi underwent growth hormone treatment, with every effort being made to nurture and prepare him for his ascension to the first team. Since making his debut against Espanyol in 2004, Messi has won trophy after trophy with  and a succession of individual awards, including four consecutive FIFA Ballons d’Or. \\r\\nHis well-documented international career began with him top-scoring as Argentina won the FIFA U-20 World Cup Netherlands 2005, though his senior debut later that year proved to be an inauspicious one, Messi being sent off only 47 seconds after coming on in a friendly against Hungary. Further frustration came when he watched from the bench as   went out to the hosts on penalties in the quarter-finals at Germany 2006, a setback followed by defeat to Brazil in final of the 2007 Copa America. There would be a happier outcome in the Men’s Olympic Football Tournament at Beijing 2008, where Messi contributed to his country’s gold-medal win.  \\r\\nThough much was expected of him at South Africa 2010, he failed to score as Argentina fell in the last eight again. Since then, however, he has become his country’s second-highest goalscorer of all time, overtaking Hernan Crespo and Diego Maradona, his coach in South Africa, in the process. An object of criticism from some  fans in the past, Messi has been attracting plenty of praise since the appointment of Sabella, who has elevated him to the captaincy and built the team around him. With ten goals,  was his country’s leading scorer in the qualifiers for Brazil 2014. \\r\\nWhile his status as one of the greatest players ever to walk the Earth is not in question, Messi is intent on winning a World Cup and safeguarding his legacy as an all-time legend. Following an up-and-down season with his club, during which he has been hampered by injury, he heads to Brazil rested and determined to achieve his goal. "

        "Rodrigo PALACIO": "The son of a Spanish footballer who played in Argentina, Rodrigo Palacio is a versatile centre-forward who is known primarily for his poaching ability but whose pace and dribbling skills also make him well suited to wide roles. Dubbed (The Jewel) for his array of skills, the right-footed Palacio began his professional career in the Argentinian second division in 2002. After trying his luck with Real Betis in Spain two years later, he signed for Banfield, spending six months there before joining the mighty Boca Juniors at the start of 2005. \\r\\nHis stop-start international career began that same year, when Jose Pekerman selected him for a friendly in March. Though he did not make the trip to the FIFA Confederations Cup in Germany and was hardly used in the qualifiers for Germany 2006, Palacio did make the squad for the world finals, where he played one game. \\r\\nDespite collecting the adidas Bronze Ball at the FIFA Club World Cup Japan 2007 and staying in among the goals with Boca, Palacio virtually disappeared from the  set-up thereafter. His return came when Alejandro Sabella took over, by which time he was enjoying his most productive season with Genoa. The front man has since moved on to Inter Milan, where he has become a first-team regular. Sabella has kept the player in his plans, using him in eight Brazil 2014 qualifiers, during which Palacio scored one goal. "

        "Sergio AGUERO": "Sergio Aguero has been making a splash from day one, having become the youngest player to feature in the Argentinian top flight when he made his debut for Independiente in 2003 at the age of 15 years, one month and three days. , as he is nicknamed after a Japanese anime character, is a prolific forward who loves running at defenders. He is equally at home leading the line or in a support role, as evidenced by his potent partnership with Lionel Messi and Gonzalo Higuain at international level. Aguero was still young enough to represent the Argentina U-17s when he won the 2005 FIFA U-20 World Cup in the Netherlands, where he played a bit-part role off the bench. Though Jose Pekerman decided against taking him to the 2006 FIFA World CupTM in Germany, his successor, Alfio Basile, handed the prodigy his first senior cap later that year. Still, his real breakthrough tournament was his second U-20 World Cup, Canada 2007, where he captained the team to glory, scoring six times along the way and scooping the adidas Golden Ball and Golden Shoe awards. This was the cue for Aguero to step it up a level at Atletico Madrid, where he had been eased into the team following a big-money move the previous year. He crowned a great second season at the club with his performances at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, bagging a brace against Brazil in the semi-finals as Argentina took gold. The tricky forward was practically ever-present in qualifying for South Africa 2010, netting four times. The tournament itself, however, was a different story. Though he had given his then father-in-law Diego Maradona his first grandson in 2009, Aguero was less productive on the pitch under the Argentinian legend's stewardship, failing to break his duck in three appearances at the finals. Following the 2011 Copa America, the forward joined English side Manchester City, where he enjoyed his most prolific season to date. He capped the campaign by scoring arguably the most important goal of his career – a last-gasp effort that sealed City's first title in 44 years. Aguero has been a mainstay of the  set-up under Alejandro Sabella. However, he only forced his way into the starting line-up on the road to Brazil 2014 after coming off the bench to grab the winner against Colombia in the fourth round of fixtures. He established himself as a pivotal figure in the team's attacking play thereafter, scoring five times in eight qualifiers in all, and will be hoping to spearhead Argentina's bid for glory this summer.

He tried his luck again two years later with third division side Club Atletico Estudiantes and decided to make a go of it. A speedy forward and elusive dribbler, his sudden changes in pace and improving finishing skills make Lavezzi a handful for any defence. \\r\\nAfter a fleeting stay with Genoa in 2004 he signed for San Lorenzo, winning a league title with them in 2007, at which point he returned to Italy, this time to Napoli. A firm favourite with the fans at the San Paola, he then moved on for a big fee to Paris Saint-Germain, where he has become an integral part of the side. \\r\\nIt was in 2007 that Alfio Basile gave him his national-team debut, and though he did not feature in the Copa America in Venezuela that year, he made the trip to Beijing 2008 and scored twice in Argentina’s Olympic gold-medal campaign. Though included in Diego Maradona’s 30-man shortlist for South Africa 2010, Lavezzi failed to make the cut for the world finals.

        "Tim CAHILL": "A tireless contributor and consistent goalscorer during his national team career, Tim Cahill’s status among Australia’s all-time greats has long been assured.  An ability to rise to the occasion when it matters was famously underlined at Germany 2006, when Cahill bagged a late double within a matter of minutes against Japan. The goals were Australia first-ever at a FIFA World Cup™ and helped the Socceroos to their maiden win on the world stage, lifting Cahill’s profile to stratospheric levels in his homeland. His goal against Serbia at South Africa 2010 – typically a dynamic headed strike – means Cahill is the only Australian to score at two World Cups.  Despite a modest build Cahill is surely one of the world’s greatest exponents of the art of heading. An uncanny ability to time an impressive leap, combined with a considerable dose of heroism, has made Cahill a fans’ favourite throughout his club and international career.  A double against Ecuador earlier this year lifted Cahill to 31 goals and past Damian Mori’s long-standing national record.  However, it could have all been so different. Born in Sydney to a Samoan mother, Cahill briefly played for the Polynesians’ U-20 team and was deemed ineligible to feature for the Socceroos until he was 24 following a change in FIFA’s eligibility regulations in 2004.  Though a fiercely proud Australian, Cahill retains a strong connection to his Samoan heritage and has been known to occasionally celebrate a goal by mimicking a  stroke; Polynesian’s popular canoe sport.  Cahill remains a highly regarded figure at Everton following eight years of consistent and loyal service at Goodison Park, which ended in 2012 with a move to New York Red Bulls. Late last year Cahill netted after just seven seconds in a match for New York, considered to be the fastest goal in Major League Soccer history.  Cahill has mostly filled an attacking midfield role throughout his national team career, though increasingly in recent years he has been deployed as a central striker, including during Ange Postecoglou's era as coach.

Leckie is a direct running attacker who generally likes to play high on the right but is capable of slotting in anywhere across the frontline.  This season has been a breakthrough campaign of sorts for Leckie who has been a regular for Bundesliga 2 side FSV Frankfurt - alongside fellow national team player Nikita Rukavytsya - where he has been a first-team regular and increased his goalscoring ratio considerably. Prior to joining Frankfurt, Leckie was at Borussia Monchengladbach though he made only a handful of Bundesliga appearances.  Though born in Melbourne, Leckie made his name in the A-League at Adelaide United under current Socceroos assistant coach Aurelio Vidmar. He made an immediate impact scoring a spectacular goal in just his second appearance.  Leckie made his international debut in late 2012 in an international against Korea Republic and has received intermittent calls-up to the national squad since then.  "

At just 20 years of age Taggart netted 16 goals for the erratic Jets becoming the youngest player to take out the league’s top goalscorer award, and just the second Australian to do so over the past six seasons. A classic No9 Taggart has a natural goalscorers instinct and when in form is deadly in and around the penalty area. He was the first choice striker for the Young Socceroos at last year’s FIFA U-20 World Cup filling the central role in the same 4-2-3-1 formation favoured by Postecoglou.  He made his senior national team debut in late 2012 during East Asian Championship qualifying and his two goals against Chinese Taipei bizarrely tallied more than his A-League goalscoring record at that point.  One of numerous young players to have come out of Perth in recent years Taggart made the move from home-town club Perth Glory to Newcastle and, after a modest first season, blossomed alongside former England striker Emile Heskey.

Nevertheless, Halloran was an outside selection for the final 23-man roster having only made his international debut a few weeks prior to the FIFA World Cup™ in Australia’s final home match against South Africa.  Like several of his Socceroo team-mates Halloran is blessed with blistering pace, and normally slots in wide on the right where his direct running can unsettle defences.  Born in Cairns in Australia’s remote north, Halloran grew up in Brisbane and made his senior start at nearby Gold Coast United. After making an immediate impression Halloran was head-hunted by several clubs, including Postecoglou’s Melbourne Victory, before settling on a move to hometown club Brisbane Roar.

It was in the summer of 2011 that the rapidly maturing Belgian finally moved abroad, joining Chelsea in a high-profile transfer. While delighted to be training alongside the likes of Didier Drogba, his childhood idol, Lukaku found playing time hard to come by at the London side. Loaned out to West Bromwich Albion and then Everton, he has proceeded to exhibit the same eye for goal that originally helped to make his name.

Just 22 minutes separated Safet Susic’s side with a play-off for a place in Brazil – a hurdle they had fallen at in the 2010 qualifiers – when the No9 did what he has done prolifically for his country, Hoffenheim and Stuttgart since 2007.  Ibisevic was brought up in Switzerland and the USA, where he played in the US Premier Development League. There, he caught the eye of Paris Saint-Germain coach and fellow Bosnian Vahid Halilhodzic, who took him to the French capital. The youngster was swiftly loaned out to Dijon and, when Halilhodzic vacated the PSG reins, Ibisevic joined the French second-tier team on a permanent basis.  The big forward failed to hit the heights at Dijon, Alemannia Aachen or in his first season at Hoffenheim, which ended with the club securing promotion to the Bundesliga. In his second term in Baden-Wurttemberg, however, Ibisevic electrified. His 18 goals in 17 league games had Hoffenheim implausibly sitting top in January before he was ruled out for the remained of the campaign and his team went into a rapid descent, ultimately finishing seventh.  Ibisevic continued to ripple nets for Hoffenheim before transferring to Stuttgart in January 2012, since which he has managed to average over a goal every two games.

It was not, however, always plain sailing for Dzeko. He started out as a midfielder for Zeljeznicar in his homeland, but the club considered him too burly for the position and he was allowed to join Czech side Teplice. Initially loaned out, Dzeko returned, was converted into a forward, and finished joint-second on the 2006/07 Gambrinus Liga scoring chart.\\r\\nThat return piqued the interest of Wolfsburg, and €4m took the player across the border.

He finished it with 26 goals and ten assists in 32 Bundesliga games. Wolfsburg finished it with their first title. Moreover, Dzeko’s 54-goal partnership with Grafite proved the deadliest in German top-flight history, surpassing the total Bayern Munich legends Gerd Muller and Uli Hoeness managed between them in 1971/72.  Dzeko left Wolfsburg for Manchester in January 2011 for €32m.

Far from getting carried away, however, like any good goal-getter Fred knows he must remain constantly alert, ready to sniff out the next chance to find the net, as his opponents witnessed during the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013 where he scored five goals.    “Now, I’ve been able to spend more time with  too and find out what he expects from the team.

I’m just concentrating on keeping playing well for my club, to ensure I get selected and can do an effective job for ,” said the experienced forward, who played and scored for Brazil at Germany 2006, when speaking to . Thoroughly benefitting from Fred’s hunger for goals and international recognition are his club , where he is a huge fan favourite. And it is hardly surprising: in the  side’s 2012 Brasileirao championship win, the No9 not only topped the divisional scorer’s charts but was chosen as the competition’s best player. With his classic, gutsy style of play, fighting against defenders and injuries, Fred developed a strong bond with the club. The striker, who spent four seasons in France playing for Lyon, tells  that “if I was asked to see out the rest of my career here, I’d sign up straight away”. "

        "NEYMAR": "Hailed as a prodigy since his early teens and a much-talked about figure on the international football scene for years now, Neymar would appear at first glance to be a seasoned veteran. Yet in real terms, we are still in the formative phase of the career of a striker who is, at the tender age of 22, already seen as  leading man. His ability with the ball at his feet, be it in exhilarating short dribbles or long mazy runs, is what strikes you most about the winner of the FIFA Puskás Award for 2011’s finest goal, along with a finalist for the same award in 2012 and 2013. But that is by no means the only way the versatile attacker can break down even the most stubborn of defences. Having evolved as a player year in year out, Neymar is also now a threat from distance with either foot, an adept penalty-area opportunist and a fine provider of chances for his team-mates, even in the tightest of situations. A complete package, the seemingly tireless front-runner is also the subject of frequent praise from coaches due to his impressive commitment to the game, whatever the occasion. Averaging two trophies a year with club side Santos in 2010, 2011 and 2012 – the highlights being wins in the 2010 Copa do Brasil and 2011 Copa Libertadores – Neymar, now a Barcelona star, was also a member of the Brazil squad that claimed silver at the Olympic Football Tournament London 2012. With his almost limitless potential, the fleet-footed forward is well aware of the expectations on his shoulders ahead of his first FIFA World Cup™. “The pressure is really great. Wherever we play there’s always pressure, but it’s going to be even greater on home soil,” he told . “We’re aware of that, but we enjoy it – it’s a good type of pressure. I’ve been fortunate enough to play in the finals of various championships, and feeling that pressure to win is marvellous. We’re ready for all of that, as it’s something Brazilian players take in their stride.\" "

All I wanted was to be a football player.” Thanks to his ability on the ball, Bernard turned attention away from his lack of height. Loaned out to Democrata de Sete Lagoas, he starred in the second division of the Minas Gerais state championship, where his performances caught the eye of Atletico Mineiro coach Dorival Jr, who gave him his first chance in the first team. Further opportunities would come following the arrival of Cuca as coach in 2011, the youngster seizing them to cement his place in the first team and be named the best newcomer of the 2012 Brazilian championship season. He also won the Copa Libertadores 2013, an accolade that proved his stepping stone to a place in the Brazil squad, before moving to Ukraines’ Shakhtar Donetsk. "

He was more than ready for the job.  Even at the age of 27, the rangy forward still has plenty to prove in the game, despite having pulled on the jerseys of a host of big-name clubs at home and abroad. Indeed, his well-travelled footballing existence has been made possible by an early start, having made his professional debut for Corinthians at the age of just 16 years, three months and 29 days –  youngest-ever debutant. The then-teenager caught the eye thanks to a rare combination of height (1.89m) and technique and, though still without the physical robustness of an old-fashioned No9, Jo was from the off adept at pulling wide and working the flanks. Now, some ten years on, he has also represented CSKA Moscow, Manchester City, Everton, Galatasaray and Internacional, as well as featuring for Brazil at the Men’s Olympic Football Tournament Beijing 2008.  Retaining the ability to drop deep or into wide areas, Jo has improved his penalty-area prowess and has been thriving on the quality service of his Atletico-MG team-mates. The same happened in the FIFA Confederations Cup, in which he scored two goals even with reduced minutes, replacing Fred. "

Rejected by both Colo Colo and Universidad Catolica, Alexis was given his chance by Cobreloa aged 15 and responded in style, making his debut in the Chilean top flight a year later under Nelson Acosta. By then, he had already been dubbed  (the wonder boy) both by his club and the Chile U-17 team. Bought by Udinese, he was loaned back to Colo Colo and then River Plate, where he won two Chilean championships and an Argentinian title, respectively. Sanchez shone too for Chile at the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada, a competition which saw the emergence of the country’s golden generation. By that time, he was already part of the senior squad as well, having made his debut a year earlier, again under Acosta.

Armed with that experience he went on to triumph in Udine too, forming a lethal partnership with Antonio Di Natale, his fantastic form earning him a move to Barcelona in 2011. As well as adding a number of titles to his collection, Sanchez has developed his game and matured in the Catalan capital, where he has featured on the left and as a centre-forward. Under Claudio Borghi and Jorge Sampaoli, he played 1,071 minutes on the way to Brazil 2014 and following a season of ups and downs for Barça, Chile hope he will be back to his brilliant best at the World Cup.

Having previously represented Chile at U-17 and U-20 level, he was given his first full international cap by Juvenal Olmos in 2003, less than a year into his professional career. The hype only intensified when the then teenager was snapped up by Inter Milan, one of Zamorano's former clubs. However, immaturity and a string of injuries curtailed Pinilla's progress and the forward became a journeyman, bouncing between eight different clubs in four years. He resurrected his career at lower-league Italian outfit Grosseto, where his goalscoring form caught the eye of Palermo and sparked rumours of a potential international comeback, which eventually came about in 2011 under Claudio Borghi. He was recalled again in 2013, this time by Jorge Sampaoli, for a Brazil 2014 qualifying double-header. Another good season in Italy and the fact that he offers something different to most of Chile's other forwards secured his seat on the plane to Brazil. "

The target man has only made one international appearance since mid-2013, and that was in a friendly. However, finishing as the top goalscorer in the league for the fourth time in his career was enough to earn the sharpshooter a second bite at the cherry on the world stage, having played twice at South Africa 2010. A product of the Santiago Morning academy, Paredes twice led the domestic scoring charts during his years at his alma mater: in 2005, when the club won promotion to the top flight, and in 2009. He followed up the latter achievement by becoming a regular at international level under Marcelo Bielsa and making the big move to Colo Colo, where he endeared himself to the fans by helping the Santiago giants to the 2009 Clausura title.

The 23-year-old winger made his debut with Atletico Nacional in 2008, setting sail three years later for Cagliari, where his mazy dribbling has made him a favourite with the fans. After representing Colombia at youth level he received his first call-up to the senior team in 2010, though he was unable to cement a place in the side. Despite not using him in the qualifiers for Brazil 2014, Jose Pekerman is an ardent admirer of the elusive Ibarbo and began adding him to his squads in late 2013, aware that his ability to glide past opponents could prove a formidable weapon for Colombia at the world finals.

        "Carlos BACCA": "His speed, ability to carve himself out scoring opportunities, and predatory instincts in front of goal make Carlos Bacca a player any coach would want in their team. And at the age of 27, the Sevilla centre-forward heads to Brazil 2014 in the form of his life. Bacca’s career is atypical, given that he did not star in Colombia’s top flight until the age of 23. Nevertheless, he has since made up for lost time, and when he was handed an opportunity by Junior de Barranquilla, he grabbed it. The striker’s impressive performances in the Colombian league earned him a transfer to Europe with Club Brugge in 2012. Bacca proved a revelation in Belgium, finishing as the league’s top scorer in his second season, with 25 goals in 35 games. He then took another step up by joining Sevilla last summer. After making his debut in a friendly against Bolivia in 2010, Bacca was not recalled to the Colombia squad until October 2012. Since then, however, he has been vying for his place in the team coached by Jose Pekerman. In the World Cup qualifiers, the 27-year-old featured in three games, although only once as a starter.  "

Ramos came to prominence at America de Cali and first featured for his country at the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2003. There, he was part of a Colombia squad which also included current team-mates Fredy Guarin and Cristian Zapata. Six years later, he finally made the move to Europe, although his five-season spell at Hertha Berlin has not always been smooth, with two of those spent in Germany’s second division. After making his full international debut in 2008 and playing six games in the qualifiers in the build-up to South Africa 2010, Ramos also featured at the Copa America in 2011. The striker then lost his place, even though he was part of coach Jose Pekerman’s plans at the beginning of the qualifying campaign for Brazil 2014.

Those that saw Martinez Sr in action say he was a prodigious header of the ball, a quality his son has inherited, making him a major threat at set pieces. Technically gifted despite being over six foot tall, Martinez is a tireless worker, forever closing down opponents and creating space for team-mates. Adept at passing and shooting first time, he has a penchant for making acrobatic attempts on goal. He made his professional debut for Independiente Medellin in 2004. After scoring 17 goals in 20 matches for them in 2009 he switched to Jaguares of Mexico, where he stayed for three years before signing for Porto. Given the brief of replacing his countryman Radamel Falcao, Martinez has risen to the challenge superbly. An international since 2009, he took part in the preliminaries for South Africa 2010 and the 2011 Copa America before making seven appearances in the Brazil 2014 qualifiers. Though he failed to score in those games, the  striker is full of confidence heading into the world finals, telling : “Playing in the World Cup will be the biggest step in my career.” "

Coming of age in the Saprissa youth system, Campbell spent his first two professional years - from 2009 to 2011 - with the club's senior squad. In August of 2011, the much sought-after Campbell signed a five-year contract with English side Arsenal. Despite the contract, Arsenal and Campbell struggled to obtain a work permit, and so he has spent the past few seasons building his skills with Lorient, Betis and Olympiacos. Campbell has been impressing teams across Europe with his precision, quick feet and steady presence on the field, all qualities he is prized for on his home turf as well.  Internationally, Campbell represented Costa Rica in the U-17 CONCACAF Championship in 2009 and again in the U-20 edition of the competition in 2011. His hard work and tenacity in the 2011 tournament saw him finish as top scorer.

Starting in 2003 and before his amicable departure in 2006, Ruiz helped usher in various regional titles, including the CONCACAF Champions' Cup. In July of 2006, Ruiz moved to Gent and in a little over a year he earned the captain’s armband and became top scorer for the team. His strong performance for the Belgians caught the eye of several Dutch teams and in July of 2009 Ruiz signed with FC Twente. In May 2010, his team won their first Eredivise title in club history and it is more than fair to say Ruiz was essential to Twente’s success. He finished the season as the team’s top scorer and by August 2011 was being closely watched by a plethora of English Premier League sides.  Fulham successfully landed Ruiz in 2011, and the forward enjoyed a fine run of form until he broke his foot in April 2012. Ruiz had difficulty regaining his spot in the starting XI after the injury, but he finished the 2012/13 campaign with five goals, and he is currently enjoying a productive loan with Dutch heavyweights PSV.  While he has continually proven his worth at the club level, Ruiz has not been able to consistently reproduce his goal scoring touch for Costa Rica, despite earning more than 60 caps. That will only fuel Ruiz to impress at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™, which could prove to be very troublesome for opposing defences. And with 17 appearances in South Africa 2010 and another 11 during the Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign, Ruiz’s experience at the highest levels of international football gives him the added confidence needed to succeed this summer.

An impressive first season set the forward up for success with the Nordic club, and he did not disappoint. He was the top scorer in 2006 with 13 goals, six of them headers. He helped his team win promotion to the Norweigian Tippeligaen, where they finished fourth, in part thanks to Brenes’ hard work. Because of his successes with Bodo, Brenes was loaned to fellow Norwegian club Kongsvinger. He is credited with helping that team also remain in Norway’s top league. Shortly afterwards, however, Brenes longed for the Costa Rican warmth and terminated his contract in Norway to return home to live with his family. He returned in 2010 to Cartagines and quickly became their top scorer. In a slightly surprising move for a rising star, Brenes moved in 2012 to Azerbaijan to play for Khazar Lankaran on a two-year contract. After finding only rocky footing on the Central Asian pitch, he once again returned home to play for Cartagines.

The striker got his start, like many of his team-mates, with Alajuelense and put away ten goals in three years for the Costa Rican club, winning the 2010 Invierno championship along the way. Urena took a different direction in 2011, though, signing for Russian Premier League side Kuban Krasnodar. His playing time has fluctuated while in Russia, but he still managed to make the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup side and scored three goals in two games in that competition.

What is more, just a few weeks after arriving in Florence, he was given his senior international debut by then coach Igor Stimac and scored in a win over Lichtenstein. Stimac was replaced as coach by Niko Kovac in October, but if anything that has been yet another positive for the ambitious Rebic, who had previously played under Kovac in the U-21s. The new man at the helm instantly put his trust in the youngster, using him from the bench in both of Croatia’s play-off games for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ against Iceland.

The UEFA Supercup and FIFA Club World Cup titles capped an historic year for both Bayern and Mandzukic, who was voted Croatia’s Player of the Year in 2012 and 2013 and Croatia’s Sportsman of the Year in 2013. It is hard to imagine the Croatian national team without the 27-year-old.

The signs are that this could be the year for the 28-year-old Liverpudlian, who was England’s top scorer with seven goals in qualifying.  It is now over a decade since Rooney burst on to the scene, thrilling the fans of his boyhood favourites Everton with his prodigious gifts. He was 16 but could do just about anything with his strength, pace, vision and dribbling ability. His first Premier League goal summed up his ‘let-me-at-’em’ attitude: a thumping 30-yard last-minute strike that ended champions Arsenal’s 30-game unbeaten run.  Rooney soon became his country’s youngest player when making his senior debut at 17 years and 111 days in a February 2003 friendly against Australia.

Utterly fearless, the 18-year-old Rooney took Europe by storm when unleashed at the ensuing finals in Portugal. He registered four goals and might have inflicted more damage but for the fractured metatarsal he sustained with England leading Portugal in a quarter-final they eventually lost on penalties.  By the time Rooney had recovered, he was a Manchester United player following his August 2004 switch to Old Trafford for a £27m fee.

Four years on from Gelsenkirchen, Rooney had a forgettable tournament in South Africa, failing to score and criticising England fans who booed the team off against Algeria.

Untypically for a footballer, Mata likes to switch off from the pressures of the professional game by reading biographies and novels, and was studying two university degrees when football gave him the chance to pursue a new career. After starting out as a youngster at Oviedo, Mata then joined the youth set-up at Real Madrid before making the breakthrough at Valencia. It was not until he moved to Chelsea, however, that he really came into his own.  Denied a regular starting place by new Blues boss Jose Mourinho in the first half of last season, Mata, aware of the need to press his claim for a place at Brazil 2014, decided to accept an offer from Manchester United. Having represented Spain at every level from U-15 upwards, Mata made his full international debut in 2009 and formed part of the  squads that won the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™ and UEFA EURO 2012.

        "Diego COSTA": "Blending raw power, nifty footwork, pace to burn and a feisty on-the-pitch persona, Diego Costa offers far more than your average fox in the box.  Brazil-born, Costa grew up playing street football in his hometown of Lagarto, before going on to sign professional terms with Portuguese outfit Braga at the age of 16. His talent soon caught the eye of Atletico Madrid, who snapped up the marksman in 2007 and promptly farmed him out on loan.  It was not until 2012, following stints at Celta, Albacete, Valladolid and Rayo Vallecano, that Costa would get the chance to make his mark in the  first team. After starting the season playing understudy to Radamel Falcao and Adrian, he quickly won over coach Diego Simeone with a series of impressive performances, particularly in the Spanish Cup, in which he finished top scorer as Atletico lifted the 2012-13 edition of the trophy.  Beyond his lethal finishing – he has racked up more than 50 goals over the last year – Costa is also renowned for his versatility, which allows him to run the channels and cut into the box to devastating effect. Costa earned his first international call-up for Brazil in March 2013, featuring in two friendlies. However, after being granted Spanish citizenship in July that year, he decided to switch allegiances and represent , who were lured by his directness and goalscoring ability. An untimely injury delayed his eagerly awaited second international debut until March 2014. "

        "Remy CABELLA": "Franck Ribery’s late withdrawal from the France squad for Brazil 2014 prompted  coach Didier Deschamps to turn to Remy Cabella, the man he believes is best suited to replace the Bayern Munich winger. Nicknamed , Cabella has just enjoyed a stunning season with Montpellier, scoring 14 goals for the club – as many as he had managed in the previous four years of his professional career – and serving up five assists. A skilled performer in one-on-one situations, Cabella also possesses a fearsome shot and can light up any match with his talent on the ball. Another area in which he has developed beyond all recognition this year is his vision and reading of the game. Born in Ajaccio to a Corsican mother and an Italian father, Cabella started playing football at a very early age, joining Gazelec Ajaccio’s youth ranks before winning a place at Montpellier’s academy in 2004. Only a couple of months after turning professional, however, he suffered torn ligaments in his right knee and was out of action for some time. His French Ligue 1 debut eventually came in December 2010, while his first league goals, a brace, came in January 2012. He helped his club lift the French title five months later and has been a first choice in the side ever since.  "

The striker's journey to the top was a gradual one, however, and he began by spending five years in France's lower leagues – including one on loan in the third tier – before getting his first tilt at the elite with Montpellier in 2010/11. After that, everything began to accelerate for Giroud, and he won his maiden France cap the following season as he topped the scoring charts while helping his club win the Ligue 1 title.\\r\\nHe moved to Arsenal fresh from that landmark campaign and was immediately faced with the challenge of replacing departed forward Robin van Persie. Giroud may be less prolific than the Dutch phenomenon, yet he has proved a valuable presence up front for the Gunners, with his style and tireless effort also winning over supporters, who sing his name to the tune of The Beatles' classic 'Hey Jude'. Meanwhile, on the international stage, after first being used as an understudy to Karim Benzema, Giroud has increasingly come to be seen as an alternative option by Didier Deschamps. Indeed, it was the Arsenal man who struck the equaliser in a 1-1 draw away against Spain in a 2014 FIFA World Cup™ qualifier on 16 October 2012. "

        "Karim BENZEMA": "The word 'phenomenon' was aired more than a few times when Karim Benzema first burst onto the scene, the term both highlighting the striker's emerging talent and echoing the nickname of his idol, Ronaldo.

Indeed, he was still just 21 when a Real Madrid side looking to build a second generation of  brought him to Spain along with Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. First taught the ropes at Lyon, he made his Ligue 1 debut in January 2005. His UEFA Champions League bow came the following season, and he notched his first goal in the competition against Rosenborg, having yet to open his account in the French championship. Playing alongside proven forwards Sylvain Wiltord, Sidney Govou, Fred and Milan Baros, Benzema learned quickly and reached new heights in 2007/08, finishing top scorer and receiving France's player of the year award. Europe's leading outfits all took note, and he realised a childhood dream by joining Madrid in July 2009, leaving Lyon with a quartet of league titles to his name. His international career has followed a similar trajectory, Benzema helping France win the 2004 UEFA European U-17 Championship and prospering at U-18, U-19 and U-21 level before earning his first senior call-up in autumn 2006. Injury ruled him out on that occasion, but he eventually made his debut aged 19 in March 2007, coming on at half-time and scoring the winner in a friendly against Austria. Trailing behind Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka in the pecking order, he was left out of Raymond Domenech's squad for South Africa 2010, but he won the faith of Laurent Blanc and led the line at UEFA EURO 2012. Benzema also began the Didier Deschamps era as first choice, only for a long goal drought to cost him his place and earn Olivier Giroud promotion. The Madrid man responded with renewed form in 2013/14, forcing his way back into the side in time for Brazil 2014. "

He began his career at Homburg, switching to Kaiserslautern in 1999 and making his Bundesliga debut the following year. A dynamic and tricky striker with great aerial ability, he was the league’s top scorer at Werder Bremen in 2006 before subsequently joining Bayern Munich in 2007 and Lazio in 2011.

That lack of experience did not hold him back when he made his debut for Honduras’ Real Sociedad in 2012, the front man going on to score 12 goals in that year’s Torneo Clausura and ending it as the leading marksman.  Nicknamed , Martinez is a versatile striker with a knack for being in the right place at the right time at set pieces and who uses his muscular frame and pace to get the better of opposing defenders. His first cap came in 2013 in a friendly against Israel. He was then called up for his country’s 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ qualifiers that June but failed to see any action, though he opened his international goalscoring account a month later in a CONCACAF Gold Cup match against Haiti. Figuring once again among the Honduran league’s top scorers, Martinez’s claim to a place Brazil 2014 has proved impossible for  coach Luis Fernando Suarez to ignore. "

It is with the two giants of Tehran that Heydari has proven something of a trophy-collector, with three league titles (one with Sepahan) and a Hazfi Cup garnered down the years.  Heydari started with Aboomoslem in 2002 but he made his name in Pas, with whom he became a central figure as the side finished as runners-up in 2005/06 Iranian league. His outstanding displays saw him scooped up by Esteghlal in 2008, where he tasted his maiden league success in his debut season with the Blues.  Beyond his defensive abilities, Heydari is also a danger when rampaging down the flanks and was a member of the Iran U-23 squad that won bronze in the 2006 Asian Games. Since making his international debut against Palestine in the 2007 West Asian Football Federation Championship, he has been a regular player with Team Melli. Known for his inch-perfect crosses, he emerged one of the most consistent performers throughout Iran's qualifying campaign for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™, during which his side sealed progression in style.

        "Masoud SHOJAEI": "With Ali Karimi’s retirement from international football last year, the task of bossing Iran’s midfield fell on the shoulders of 29-year-old Masoud Soleimani Shojaei. Iranian fans know all too well that the Las Palmas midfielder’s form is the key if  are to spring a surprise or two at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™. Shaojaei emerged as a promising star during his early days with Saipa. As a teenager, he dazzled viewers with his stunning pace and sophistication on the ball, with to likening him to Karimi. His talents did not go unnoticed by then-coach Branko Ivankovic, who called him into the national team in 2004. He showed a glimpse of his genius in his international debut against Laos in a qualifier for Germany 2006, providing a superb assist as Iran won 7-0.  Despite missing the final qualifying round, Shaojaei was a surprise inclusion in Ivankovic’s World Cup squad. He had a fiery baptism on the world stage in Iran’s last match against Angola, coming on for the final 13 minutes as his side drew 1-1 for their only point.  After spending the next two years with Al Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, he left for Spain to join compatriot Javad Nekonam with Osasuna, accumulating over a century of appearances there. Meanwhile, he established his place with the national team through a series of solid displays. He figured prominently throughout Iran’s qualifying for South Africa 2010 although his side narrowly missed out on the finals itself. He may have missed Iran’s early campaign on the road to Brazil 2014 due to injury, but pulled his weight in the last four games as his side sealed progression as group winners.  Like Karimi, Shojaei is capable of marauding through rivals’ defences at will courtesy of his sublime dribbling and lightning speed. "

Despite his tender age, though, the talented midfielder has been heralded as one of the country's most promising stars. Jahan Bakhsh exploded on the Asian scene in the 2012 AFC U-19 Championship, skippering Iran through a tough group featuring Japan, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates to reach the last eight. In the process, he opened the scoring in a 1-1 draw against UAE, a result which helped them finish ahead of their three rivals with an undefeated record. It was his eye-catching displays during the Asian youth competition that convinced a watching scout from NEC Nijmegen to snap him up for the Dutch side last year.  The winger continued his good form with NEC in the Dutch Eredivisie and his brilliant performances didn't go unnoticed by Queiroz, who called him up to the national team soon after. Following his debut for Iran – as a substitute in a 2015 AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Thailand last October – he went on to score his first international goal when he sealed a 3-0 return-leg victory against the same opponents with a stoppage-time strike a month later.

The 24-year-old is, in fact, a pupil by the Iranian legend, who spotted and brought him to Saipa during his tenure in charge of the club.  Ansari graduated from the club's youth academy into the first team in 2007. The slender forward quickly established himself as Saipa's new talisman, achieving a double-digit scoring-tally for the first time in 2010. It took him just another two years to become the league's top-marksman when he edged a series of imported and home-grown stars to top the scoring-chart with 21 goals.  When former Iran manager Afshin Ghotbi called him up to the national team in 2009, the then-teenager came off the bench to score the only goal against Iceland in a friendly on his international debut. Within two years Ansari had forced his way into the starting line-up of Iran. He has racked up 9 goals in 39 international appearances thus far, including scoring three times during Iran's successful qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™.  "

The striker, in a sense, became Iran’s new rescuer during their qualifying campaign. Initially a relative unknown plying his trade in Belgium, he revived Iran's fortunes with his first goal in qualifying during a 1-0 victory in Qatar, before hitting the target again a week later in the 4-0 home defeat of Lebanon. The 26-year-old maintained his form into their final game against Korea Republic, scoring the only goal in Ulsan as they booked their passage to Brazil 2014 as group winners. Born in Iran but brought up in the Netherlands, , as he is now affectionately known to fans, was a fresh face on the Asian scene when he was called up by coach Carlos Queiroz in October 2012. Impressed by his performance for Sint-Truiden in a Belgian Jupiler Pro League game against Lierse, the former Portugal and Real Madrid boss wasted no time in calling him up.  Queiroz gave him his international debut in a crucial home qualifier against Korea Republic, starting the forward in what ended as a 1-0 Iran win. Even after a disappointing home defeat to Uzbekistan, a result which put Iran's campaign in jeopardy, Queiroz maintained his faith in Ghoochannejhad. He was eventually proven right, with scoring three goals in as many games across a fortnight, including two match-winners, as Iran progressed somewhat against the odds. The decisive goal against the Koreans was the embodiment of 's predatory talents. With Iran largely on the back foot and approaching the final half-hour, the Mashhad-born striker stole the ball from Kim Younggwon, darting to the edge of the penalty area, before unleashing a trademark left-footed strike past the goalkeeper.

Iranian fans were indebted to the Portuguese manager for his efforts in securing the services of the then VfL Wolfsburg midfielder during qualifying for Brazil 2014 three years ago. Born in Tehran and raised in Berlin, Dejegah started his career with Hertha BSC. He exploded on to the scene with the German U-19 team in 2004 as he scored seven goals from 15 matches. The prodigy naturally graduated into the German U-21 side, with whom he won the UEFA U-21 Championship in 2009.  Having played for two German youth teams, Dejagah was presented with the options of representing either his adopted country or his motherland. Both former Iran coach Afshin Ghotbi and Queiroz came calling, with his debut for Iran finally coming on 29 February 2012. He could not have made a better start with , scoring a brace as Iran drew 2-2 with Qatar in a World Cup qualifier. Later that year he secured a move to the English Premier League with Fulham, initially being limited to showing flashes of the form he had shown in Germany. However, as he has settled into the English game, despite an injury-disrupted season, he became a key figure in Fulham's fight against relegation with his pace and direct attacking purpose. Although those spells on the sidelines saw him miss several crucial World Cup qualifying matches, Dejagah played a key role during Iran successfully reaching the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.

        "Mario BALOTELLI": "Mario Balotelli leaves no one indifferent with his combination of sublime talent and his knack for attracting the wrong kind of headlines. An explosive striker, he possesses a technique so natural that he is often accused of nonchalance. What is inarguable is that Balotelli can change the course of a match with a single touch of the ball, and he is equally effective from set-pieces. Born to Ghanaian parents Thomas and Rose in Palermo on 12 August 1990, Balotelli suffered severe intestinal problems as a child and underwent a series of operations. Unable to pay for his treatment, his parents, who had moved to Lombardy, agreed to let their three-year-old son be put in a foster home. Raised by Francesco and Silvia Balotelli, he nevertheless had to wait until he turned 18 before acquiring Italian citizenship in August 2008. At the age of 17, Balotelli made his debut in Serie A for Inter Milan in December 2007. He played for three seasons at the San Siro, winning three league titles, the UEFA Champions League, a Coppa Italia and an Italian Super Cup. Along the way, he scored 28 goals in 86 games, clashing with coach Jose Mourinho and provoking his fair share of controversy. The Balotelli legend was well and truly under way. Tempted by the prospect of playing in the Premier League, the forward signed for Manchester City at the start of the 2010/11 season. The unwanted headlines followed him to England, however, and his relations with manager Roberto Mancini veered from one extreme to the other until he packed his bags for AC Milan in January 2013.  In contrast, Balotelli’s experiences with the national team have been more consistently positive. Italy coach Cesare Prandelli called him up for the first time two days short of his 20th birthday for the 1-0 defeat to Côte d'Ivoire on 10 August 2010. He went on to enjoy an excellent UEFA EURO 2012, in particular notching a semi-final double against Germany, a match during which he set himself up as the spearhead of the Italian attack.  "

At the peak of his powers, though, Cassano possesses a ball control that sets him apart from his peers, combined with the ability to dribble in tight spaces and distribute laser-guided through balls. He is most effective in his preferred  role, as a second striker behind the centre-forward.\\r\\nNicknamed , Cassano has turned out for an impressive list of big clubs, including Roma, Real Madrid, AC Milan and Inter Milan, winning league honours in both Italy and Spain. On the international stage, he represented his country in every age group before making his step up to the senior squad, for whom he has made over 30 appearances, collecting a runners-up medal at UEFA EURO 2012. Despite those achievements, the sense remains that he has not enjoyed a career to match his talents, having made as many headlines for run-ins with the likes of Fabio Capello, Marcello Lippi, Luigi Del Neri and Francesco Totti as he has for his exploits on the pitch.\\r\\nCassano has nonetheless changed since joining Parma at the start of the 2013/14 season, leaving the controversy behind him and rediscovering his best form.

Boasting fine technique and an eagerness to surge forward down the flanks, the natural left-footer can operate on the left or the right but prefers the latter as it offers better shooting opportunities. After spending his youth in Roma's academy, he made his first-team debut for the capital club aged 16 on 16 May 2004, catching the eye of then coach Fabio Capello. That was the start of a rapid rise, but Cerci's progress was soon halted by a series of injuries, the Velletri native suffering a ruptured meniscus in his knee and cruciate ligament inflammation. Following three seasons out on loan, he joined Fiorentina in 2010, only to leave two years later after falling out with the club's fans.  \\r\\nCerci represented Italy at every age group during his adolescence and finally made the step up to the senior side on 17 March 2013 against Brazil (2-2), coming off the bench to replace Andrea Pirlo.

The Napoli-born forward also has versatility on his side, being able to play across the attack, while also boasting a knack for dribbling free in tight areas and unleashing vicious snap shots with both feet.\\r\\nImmobile's route to the top has been anything but traditional, however.

A product of the Napoli youth programme, Insigne is an attacking midfielder who operates with the same deadly efficiency whether tucked in behind the centre forward or stationed on the wing. Skilful in front of goal, he is also decisive in the final pass. Insigne cut his teeth in Napoli’s youth teams. Then, in January 2010, after having made his debut in Serie A, he finished the season on loan at Cavese. It was not long before coach Zdenek Zeman noticed the young forward's flair and he obtained him a season-long loan deal with Foggia, where he scored 19 goals. The following season he went on loan to Serie B side Pescara where he helped them to win the title, racking up 18 goals and 8 assists in the process.

        "Keisuke HONDA": "Attacking midfielder Keisuke Honda has been a commanding figure in the Japanese national team in recent years, and adds a physical presence and cutting edge to the Samurai Blue attack. Honda has displayed a knack for scoring vital goals on the big stage. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup™, he bagged the only goal in Japan’s opener against Cameroon, and then drilled in a majestic long-range free-kick in the victory over Denmark. Honda’s efforts went a long way to putting Japan into the Round of 16, and he has remained an integral part of the national team since Alberto Zaccheroni became coach in 2010.  Honda’s great-uncle competed at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, and his brother also played football. Despite this sporting pedigree, Honda’s football career had an inauspicious start. Honda played for the youth team at Gamba Osaka, who boasts a widely admired youth system, but he failed to earn selection returning to high school. After completing his studies, Honda was signed by Nagoya Grampus but already had ambitions of playing overseas. He fulfilled this dream when transferred to Dutch club VVV-Venlo in 2008, the same year he made his national team debut.  The player’s appetite for goals caught the attention of CSKA Moscow, and he signed for the Russian powerhouse in 2010. In the UEFA Champions League that year, Honda made headlines when he scored with a 30m, left-foot free-kick against Sevilla, helping CSKA become only the second Russian team to reach the quarter-finals.  Before the 2010 World Cup, creative midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura had been the linchpin of Japan’s attack. But concerned by Japan’s misfiring front line, coach Takeshi Okada boldly decided to instead build his attack around Honda deploying him as a deep-lying centre forward. Honda repaid the faith and his strength, ability to retain possession and seemingly endless energy culminated in being named man of the match in the games against Cameroon, Denmark and the shoot-out defeat against Paraguay.  Since then, Honda has remained an automatic selection for the Samurai Blue. He helped power Japan to the 2011 AFC Asian Cup crown, and was hugely influential in several qualifying games on the road to Brazil, as well as the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.  In January 2014, Honda achieved a childhood dream in signing for AC Milan. Often outspoken, he has even publicly declared that Japan are aiming to win the 2014 World Cup.  "

Since making his international debut in 2011, Kiyotake has cemented a place in the national squad and was heavily involved in his nation’s qualifiers for the 2014 FIFA World Cup™.  Kiyotake’s superb performance in Japan’s upset of Spain in their opening game at the 2012 London Olympics was a clear indication of his undoubted potential. The 24-year-old was an essential component of Japan’s run to the semi-finals, where they were defeated by Korea Republic. A tireless runner, Kiyotake imbues Japan’s attack with a fearsome long-range shot and inch-perfect passes that can unlock any defence. These skills have helped Kiyotake quickly establish himself in the German top tier.  After coming through the youth academy at his hometown team of Oita Trinita in south-western Japan, Kiyotake’s appetite for goals earned him a call-up to Oita’s top side. In 2010, he transferred to Cerezo Osaka and filled the void left when attacking midfielder Shinji Kagawa was signed by Borussia Dortmund. In 2012, Kiyotake followed in his footsteps with his own move to Germany. \\r\\nAlong with Kagawa and Takashi Inui, Kiyotake is a young midfielder who has illuminated Japan’s offence in recent years.

This season Okazaki added another record to his impressive resume by surpassing Shinji Kagawa’s benchmark for most goals by a Japanese player in a Bundesliga season while in the colours of Mainz. This accomplishment evidence that the hard work Okazaki has put in since moving to Germany in 2011 is finally starting to bear fruit. “Looking back, I hadn’t achieved much in three years in Germany,” Okazaki reflected after setting the new record.  A clinical finisher capable of playing alone up front or with a strike partner, Okazaki has also been used as a winger for the Samurai Blue. Okazaki’s quick acceleration, high work-rate and tenacity have even prompted some commentators to describe the 28-year-old as a “Japanese Gerd Muller”. Not afraid to throw himself about or make diving headers, the forward clearly relishes the physical side of the game.  Okazaki began his career in 2005 with Shimizu S-Pulse, signed for Bundesliga outfit VfB Stuttgart in the winter of 2011, before moving to Mainz in 2013.  Okazaki’s ability to regularly find the target has made him a fixture in the national team. He made his debut for Japan in 2008, and endeared himself to Japanese fans the following year when he scored 15 goals in 16 appearances. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup™, he tucked away a goal in Japan’s 3-1 victory over Denmark in the group stage. Coach Alberto Zaccheroni has been a loyal advocate of Okazaki since taking over the national team, and Japan will be counting on him to maintain his knack for scoring in Brazil.  "

        "Shinji KAGAWA": "Attacking midfielder Shinji Kagawa has cemented his status as one of Japan’s most talented players since joining Manchester United in 2012, and he shoulders the extra responsibility that comes with wearing the No10 shirt for Japan.  Born in Kobe, Kagawa signed by Cerezo Osaka in 2006 while still at high school. He established himself as a key player at Cerezo between 2008 and 2010, and was instrumental in the team’s promotion to the J.League’s top flight.  Despite acquitting himself well in the top tier, Kagawa was omitted from Japan’s 2010 World Cup squad, but travelled to South Africa with the team as a ‘supporting member’. His reputation as one of Japan’s most promising players was reinforced after he joined German powerhouse Borussia Dortmund in 2010. Although relatively unheralded in Germany at the time – Kagawa had been playing in J2 until the previous year – he was a perfect fit for Dortmund’s attacking football under coach Jurgen Klopp. His appetite for goals and ability to create scoring chances for team-mates helped power Dortmund to the 2010/11 Bundesliga title.  Kagawa was poised to continue his meteoric rise in 2011, but a serious foot injury sustained in the semi-final of the AFC Asian Cup in Qatar wrecked the second half of his season, and he was not on the pitch when Dortmund sealed the title. However, the player was a vital cog the following season as Dortmund won a second consecutive crown. Kagawa’s bourgeoning performances helped pave the way for Shinji Okazaki and an ever-growing number of Samurai Blue players who now ply their trade in Germany and other European leagues.  Kagawa’s silky skills and deft passing can unlock any defence, and he is comfortable shooting with either foot. He also possesses clinical finishing, plus darting runs and movement off the ball – the latter enabling him to create space even in congested areas.  Since 2011, Kagawa has been entrusted with the No10 jersey for the national side, where he has formed a lethal attacking partnership with Keisuke Honda. Kagawa’s star shone even brighter in the summer of 2012 when he transferred to Manchester United. His highlights at Old Trafford include becoming the first Asian to score a hat-trick in the Premier League.  The 25-year-old now tends to play on the left side for club and country but during his time at Dortmund he was mostly utilised just behind the front line, where he can display his vision and creativity.  Kagawa grew up admiring Kazuyoshi ‘King Kazu’ Miura, a forward who played professional football in Brazil before returning to Japan and becoming one of the stars of the J.League’s early days.  "

His nose for goals and ability to also slot in as a “shadow striker” earned Kakitani selection to the national team at various age grades, and he could be vital to the Samurai Blue’s ambitions of reaching the quarter-finals at a FIFA World Cup™ for the first time.  Kakitani joined the respected Cerezo youth programme when he was a child, and at age 16 became the youngest player to sign a professional contract with the club’s senior team. His goal-scoring feats at the FIFA U-17 World Cup 2007 turned many heads, but he had to wait until 2013 to make his international debut for the senior team.  The 24-year-old was widely considered a football prodigy during his early days, but Cerezo loaned him to Tokushima Vortis for several seasons after becoming frustrated by several indiscretions, including repeatedly arriving late to training. After improving his professionalism at the second-tier club, Kakitani returned to Cerezo and has developed into a regular starting player.

Okubo’s playing resume includes spells both in Japan and abroad. After graduating from high school, he joined Cerezo Osaka, a noted football academy that has produced top-class players such as Shinji Kagawa and Yoichiro Kakitani. A stint with Mallorca in the Spanish league was followed by a more productive return to Vissel Kobe. In 2009, he was signed by VfL Wolfsburg, which also had current Japan captain Makoto Hasebe on its books. Despite limited opportunities, Okubo helped Wolfsburg win the Bundesliga title before returning to Japan to link up again with Vissel prior to South Africa 2010. A string of sparkling performances proved impossible for Japan coach Takeshi Okada to ignore. In South Africa, Okubo was used on the wing, but also earned plaudits for contributing heavily in defence.

Osako began his professional career with J.League powerhouse Kashima Antlers, scoring six goals in his first season and quickly becoming a key figure in Kashima’s attack. His 19 goals in 2013 earned him selection to the J.League Best Eleven that season and earmarked him as one of Japan’s most lethal strikers.  In January 2014, Osako was signed by German second-division club 1860 Munich, where he has continued to develop. An admirer of Thierry Henry, Osako’s style of play has shades of the French legend.

Saito had been tipped to play at the highest level ever since he joined the Yokohama F Marinos youth academy as a teenager. The 24-year-old has played for Marinos throughout his career, except during 2011, when he was loaned to second-division club Ehime FC. Saito ran out for Japan at several age grades, and also represented his country at the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2007 and the 2012 London Olympics.  The pocket-sized midfielder was first called up to the Samurai Blue at the 2013 East Asian Cup. Saito scored against Australia during that tournament and a string of energetic performances since then have earned him a spot in Japan’s FIFA World Cup team.

His prolific form on the domestic stage earned Park his first cap against Uzbekistan in qualifying for Germany 2006.

After undergoing a lengthy slump at his club, Park tried his luck in the French Ligue 1 with Monaco in the summer of 2008 before taking part in the Men’s Olympic Football Tournament. While he was adapting to the French top flight, Park had a successful qualifying campaign for South Africa 2010. The Watford man went on to break his duck at the finals, scoring off a free-kick in a 2-2 draw with Nigeria that secured a place in the round of 16. Park was also a key member of Hong Myungbo’s charges at the Asian Games later that year and the 2012 Men’s Olympic Tournament where the Taeguk Warriors finished third and won the bronze medal respectively.

With his deft footwork and unpredictable shots, Lee is a constant menace to opposing defences. The 29-year-old began his professional career at his hometown club Incheon United in 2005 but it was at Daegu FC where Lee came into prominence, scoring 23 goals in 59 matches in all competitions over two seasons. After a successful spell in the J.League with Jubilo Iwata and Gamba Osaka, Lee returned to his homeland to join Ulsan Hyundai in 2012. He led the attack with four goals and six assists as the Tigers won the 2012 AFC Champions League, and rounded off the season by winning the AFC Player of the Year award. Although he narrowly missed out on the squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™, Lee bounced back in style by scoring the last-gasp winner against United Arab Emirates in the third round of qualifying for Brazil 2014. Despite the managerial merry-go-round over the course of the preliminary competition, Lee continued to perform well for the Taeguk Warriors, making 12 appearances in the process. "

Koo came to prominence at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, where he scored five goals to win the golden boot as the Taeguk Warriors finished third at the continental championship. Koo's heroics in Qatar earned him a transfer to German Bundesliga side Wolfsburg, but he subsequently moved on loan to Augsburg where he was given more playing time.\\r\\nThe highlight of his promising career came in the summer of 2012, when Koo captained the Taeguk Warriors at the Men’s Olympic Football Tournament in London. His eye-catching performances in the middle of the park were key to the Taeguk Warriors fairy-tale run to the last four, and despite a 3-0 defeat to Brazil in the semi-final, Koo scored their second goal to seal a 2-0 victory against Japan in the bronze medal match in Cardiff.

There his opportune appearances from the bench not only played a key part Mexico’s triumph, it also raised his profile significantly. In the intervening years, this towering forward has gone from strength to strength.  He helped Club America win the Clausura 2013 title and reach the final in the ensuing Apertura 2013. But he reached his highest point in the CONCACAF qualifiers where his magnificent scissor-kick goal from outside the box helped Mexico overcome a gritty Panamanian side when everything seemed lost.

Playing opportunities in north London proved scarce, however, and his four years as a Tottenham player included loan spells at Ipswich Town, Galatasaray and Racing Santander. Those stints away from White Hart Lane did, at least, allow him to showcase his talents, and reinforced his need to find regular first-team football. His move to Mallorca the start of 2012/13 promised that much-needed stability, and he has duly become an important figure for the team. However, with the Balearic club seemingly destined for relegation from the Spanish top flight – despite their new recruit's best efforts – Dos Santos could soon be on the hunt for new employers once again.

Pulido's previous international highlight was a third-place finish at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2011, where his failure to find the net took nothing away from his lively performances.

The Manchester United striker has earned widespread respect for his likeable character, simple approach to the game and, above all, his uncanny knack of popping up with important goals when it really matters.   If Hernandez is an important player for his club, then he can be considered absolutely integral to the Mexican national team. The 25-year-old has scored 30 goals in only 46 international games, and appears well on course to smash the all-time record of 42 held by 's legendary former striker Jared Borgetti.   It follows, then, that Hernandez will be one of the main attractions in Mexico's squad for the FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil 2013. The coaching staff of Mexico's opponents will be all too aware of his threat, and are no doubt planning ways to negate his pace, predatory finishing and superb sense of positioning in the penalty area.   Their efforts will likely be in vain, however, as Hernandez is a player who nearly always finds a way to deliver.

The Santos Laguna man, who goes by the nickname of  (The Brush), has performed well for the full national team whenever he has been called on, though his rival for a place in the side is none other than Javier Hernandez, who enjoys hero status among Mexico fans.

        "Robin VAN PERSIE": "No-one has scored more goals for the Netherlands than Robin van Persie. The Manchester United forward claimed the all-time record in October of last year, surpassing the current assistant coach, Patrick Kluivert, with his 39th, 40th and 41th strikes for the national team in an 8-1 trouncing of Hungary.  That hat-trick was the highlight of a spectacular Brazil 2014 campaign for Van Persie, who scored 11 times in nine appearances to finish as the European Zone’s leading marksman. A trio of assists were thrown in for good measure as this multi-talented striker re-affirmed his central importance to the team being built by Louis van Gaal.  The Netherlands coach underlined his belief in Van Persie by naming him captain last June, stripping Wesley Sneijder of the role, and that controversial decision has been justified in the time since. The Manchester United star has certainly improved steadily with age, maturing from the raw but talented winger first seen at Feyenoord into one of the world’s most accomplished centre-forwards. His goal tally over recent years for club and country reflects that. In 2012/13, he topped the English Premier League goalscoring chart for the second season in succession – the first player to do so for two different clubs (Arsenal and United) since Three Lions legend Alan Shearer.  He is, though, coming into the FIFA World Cup™ at the end of his most difficult and injury-plagued season in some time, with United’s struggles widely attributed to the infrequency of his appearances. Van Persie will also be keen to improve on his scoring record at major finals, having endured a miserable UEFA EURO 2012 and been less than prolific at his previous three EURO and World Cup outings. \\r\\nBut with Van Gaal set to make him the focal point of the Dutch attack, the smart money would be on the Oranje’s record goalscorer adding a few more to his tally on Brazilian soil.

        "Arjen ROBBEN": "Brazil 2014 will be Arjen Robben’s sixth major tournament for the Netherlands and, at 30, he remains one of the team’s key players. Speed, dribbling ability and a deadly left foot have established the Bayern Munich winger as one of the most exciting talents of his generation, and Louis van Gaal – like so many of his predecessors – puts a high value on his importance.  Robben’s favoured method of attack, drifting in from the right wing to shoot on his favoured side, is so well known as to seem almost predictable. But stopping him continues to prove consistently difficult. It is not for nothing that three of Europe’s most successful clubs - Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich - have paid a combined €75 million to acquire his services, with Robben proving a success in every league in which he has played.  He first came to the world’s attention while with PSV Eindhoven, and it was during his time with the Dutch giants that he gained his first taste of international football. The winger was just 20 when he was named in Dick Advocaat’s squad for UEFA EURO 2004, and even then showed the ability and character that would keep him in the Dutch line-up for years to come.  South Africa 2010 was arguably his best tournament to date, with Robben’s dynamic performances for the finalists reflected by his place among the nominees for the adidas Golden Ball. Cruelly, though, his contribution to that FIFA World Cup is often best remembered for a crucial miss in the deciding match against Spain, and he was lampooned in 2012 after failing to convert a potentially match-winning penalty for Bayern Munich in the Champions League final against Chelsea.  Robben, though, is made of stern stuff and he secured redemption last year with the winning goal as Bayern made up for that 2012 disappointment with victory over Borussia Dortmund in the same fixture. The Dutch will now hope that this outstanding player can help write a better ending to their 2014 story than the fairy tale-turned-tragedy of South Africa.  "

        "Dirk KUYT": "At 33, and with his 34th birthday beckoning just nine days after the Brazil 2014 Final, Dirk Kuyt is one of the Netherlands’ elder statesmen. Though not blessed with the natural skill of team-mates such as Robben, Sneijder and Van Persie, the veteran forward has been a favourite of successive coaching regimes due to the selflessness and tirelessness of his performances.  Kuyt, having made his debut under Marco van Basten in 2004, has a decade of international experience behind him and is currently closing in on his 100th cap. He was certainly a key player for the Dutch at South Africa 2010, when he started all seven games, including the Final, contributing a goal, three assists and boundless effort to the Netherlands’ excellent campaign.  The former Liverpool and Feyenoord forward’s international career looked to be drawing to a close when he lost his place in the team at UEFA EURO 2012, and soon after was removed as vice-captain by Louis van Gaal. However, while he is not a guaranteed starter these days, Kuyt continues to prove his worth and made five appearances during the Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign. Van Gaal will know only too well that, in this committed and unfussy performer, he has the most dependable of stalwarts.  "

The 26-year-old’s performances, allied to his versatility, make him a certainty to feature in Louis van Gaal’s squad and someone who could well play a key role at the FIFA World Cup itself.  It could all have been so different for Lens, who in 2009 declared his intention to play for Suriname, competing for his adopted nation in the PARBO Bier Cup. Fortunately, as the tournament did not take place under FIFA’s auspices, the Amsterdam-born forward and former Dutch U-21 international remained eligible for the country of his birth – and the call came in 2010.  Lens’ name was one of those cut from Bert van Marwijk’s provisional squad for that year’s World Cup, although the appointment of Louis van Gaal – his former coach at AZ – has resulted in him becoming a regular. This pacey and direct forward, who can play anywhere across the front line and as a No10, also completed the first overseas move of his career last year, joining Dynamo Kiev from PSV Eindhoven for a reported €15million. He is sure to be a player well worth watching at Brazil 2014.  "

        "Klaas Jan HUNTELAAR": "With 34 goals in 60 international appearances, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar boasts a goalscoring record of which any top-class striker would be proud. Yet despite these figures, and his place among the top ten marksmen in his country’s history, this is a player who has rarely been the Netherlands’ first-choice No9.  His misfortune has been to coincide with Robin van Persie, the man who tops that all-time scoring list, and the player who outscored all others in the European Zone qualifiers for Brazil 2014. Nonetheless, Huntelaar - as the statistics show – has proved himself to be a more than adequate deputy whenever he has been called upon.  Louis van Gaal clearly values the Schalke star as a penalty box predator, and though he played just twice during the Netherlands’ preliminary campaign, he was still able to contribute two goals and an assist. Then again, finding the net has rarely proved a problem for Huntelaar in a career that has already brought him over 200 goals for both club and country.  Beloved by fans of AGOVV, Heerenveen and Ajax in his homeland, where his scoring ratio was close to a goal-a-game, the striker made the first big move of his career in 2009 when Real Madrid paid €20 million to take him to the Bernabeu. While his scoring record remained respectable, Madrid opted to offload him within a year, and a €15 million switch to AC Milan proved similarly unfulfilling.  It was only when Huntelaar agreed a move to Schalke in 2010 - with €14 million the fee on this occasion - that he finally found a home, and began to rediscover the form that had made him one of Europe’s sought-after strikers. Already into the top five of the Gelsenkirchen club’s all-time leading marksmen, he finished as the Bundesliga’s top scorer in 2011/12 with 29 goals and remains a dependable match-winner.  "

Speed, trickery and a powerful shot have already led to the young forward being likened to Arjen Robben and Eden Hazard, and Louis van Gaal has recognised his potential with a handful of senior appearances.  Though right-footed, he it utilised most often on the left flank as an inverted winger, a position from which he utilised his speed and skill to cut inside and unleash ferocious strikes on goal. Set pieces are also a speciality, and Depay - who plays with a self-assurance that belies his age - will no doubt be jostling with Messrs Van Persie and Sneijder for free-kick opportunities should the opportunity arise.  Disciplinary problems plagued the early part of his career, but with those issues seemingly put behind him at PSV, Depay - who was also eligible for Ghana through his father - is emerging as one of the most sought-after young players in European football.

Musa is rated so highly by coach Stephen Keshi that he was one of just three players in the Super Eagles team that featured in all eight 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ qualifiers. He also held his own in five of six matches as Nigeria won the CAF Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 and played in all three of Nigeria's matches at last year's FIFA Confederations Cup. \\r\\nThese impressive national team experiences have also been supplemented by a successful career so far in European club football.

He was, however, recalled by Stephen Keshi into the extended squad for Brazil and then came on as a substitute in Nigeria's 2-2 draw against Scotland at the end of May. Keshi's decision to pick the Stoke City player, who scored six goals in 15 outings for the English Premier League club this year, is a sign of the confidence that Keshi has in Odemwingie's scoring abilities. The former Lokomotiv Moscow forward gives Keshi plenty of options upfront as he can be used in just about any position: as the only striker, a support striker, wide on either flank or even in midfield, where he can use his creativity to create plays. He first played for Nigeria in 2002 and captained the side at the finals of the 2010 AFCON before playing at the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ finals in South Africa.

Emenike, whose strengths include power and pace, continued scoring with reckless abandon in the top flight, and it was natural that a bigger club would come calling. A dream move to Fenerbahce materialised before he was implicated and later cleared of involvement in a match-fixing scandal, although it led to him being sold to Russian club Spartak Moscow without having played for the Istanbul giants. After spending two seasons in Moscow, where he scored a goal every other game, he transferred back to Fenerbahce before the 2013/14 season and kept up the same scoring rate. His talent has continued to draw interest from clubs in bigger leagues, and a breakout FIFA World Cup would do his prospects no harm. Since breaking into the Nigerian national team in 2011, Emenike has become a valuable member of the impressive side that Stephen Keshi has built. The striker was one of the stand-out players as the Super Eagles won the Africa Cup of Nations for the third time in their history in South Africa last year and even though he had to miss the final through injury, finished joint top scorer of the competition.

His speed and crossing ability proved valuable enough for him to work his way up the ranks from Crystal Palace to Wigan Athletic and then to giants Chelsea, where he played in the FIFA Club World Cup.   Moses was then in the Nigeria team that won a third African title in South Africa in 2013, but his national team success was followed by a loan move to Liverpool at the beginning of the 2013/4 season. As Liverpool mounted a strong title challenge, Moses struggled to force his way into the starting line-up and was used mainly as a late substitute.  He was a more prominent figure in Stephen Keshi's squad for the FIFA World Cup™ qualifiers, playing in six of the country's matches as the Super Eagles kept their momentum up to reach Brazil 2014.

Ironically, Dike had last year replaced the injured Nwofor for two international matches. Nwofor first made a name for himself with Nigeria's U-20 side as the Flying Eagles won the Africa Youth Championship in 2011.

He joined Newcastle United as a youngster and has been with the club ever since, aside from a very brief spell on loan at Stoke City.

Shola has played over 300 matches for Newcastle – more than any other member of the 2013/4 squad - but although he managed more than 20 first team appearances in the Premier League this season, he has been little more than a bit-player, often coming on as a late substitute.

Almeida has all the qualities you do not find in the archetypal Portuguese striker, and as such the Besiktas marksman gives Paulo Bento a different option.  He came through the ranks at Porto, making his debut at 19, but opportunities were few and far between and a series of loan moves ensued. He found time to leave his mark at Porto though, above all on two occasions that are engraved in the memories of the club’s fans. He netted in the inauguration match of the new Estadio do Dragao, and scored a quite stupendous strike in the UEFA Champions League at Inter Milan.  In 2006/07 he was on loan again, this time at Werder Bremen, and it was in Germany that Almeida came to the fore. The Bundesliga outfit got the best out of the burly striker and they subsequently made the move permanent. He played for Werder for four years, before moving to Besiktas, Turkey.  \\r\\nAlmeida made the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™ and has been a regular in the squad ever since, often starting to give Portugal more firepower up front.

His return did not go unnoticed by Bento, who promptly restored him to the national fold, a sign of how far the player has come in recent years. Denied much of an opportunity at Porto at the start of his career, Vieirinha moved abroad in search of first-team football. He found it in Greece with PAOK, using his speed and technique to great effect in three and a half successful seasons before moving to Wolfsburg of Germany. He continued to develop his game in the Bundesliga, where his performances earned him a call-up to the full national team, having already played for his country at the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2003.

He first played for  (Sunflower Home), an institution in Coimbra that cares for children at risk and which Eder continues to support and visit today, showing that his success has not made him forget his humble origins.  He signed for Sporting Braga at the start of 2012/13 and shortly afterwards realised his dream of playing for Portugal, in a qualifying match against Azerbaijan for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™.  Portugal seemed to have found another option for their attack, but life had another test lined up for Eder. In March 2013 he tore his ligaments in his right knee, ruling him out of action for six months. When he finally returned he promptly broke a toe.  His World Cup dream looked over, but whatever obstacles life throws his way, Eder has shown tremendous determination to overcome them.

After cheering on and then seeing depart Sporting heroes such as Luis Figo, Simao Sabrosa, Ricardo Quaresma and Cristiano Ronaldo, in 2005/06 fans got to see the most recent world-class wide player sprout from the club’s grass roots.  Born on the African island of Cape Verde, Nani moved to Portugal at a young age and it was sport that moulded his character. As well as football, he practised the Brazilian martial art of capoeira for many years, which afforded him mobility and elasticity, and was where he learned his trademark backflip when celebrating his goals.  His first club was Real Massama, from where Sporting picked him up, and Nani’s outstanding skills saw him successfully ascend through the youth ranks to the professional game. He made his debut for the first team in 2005/06, but his extraordinary quality and competitiveness meant just two years later Manchester United were in for him. In the wake of their successful purchase of Cristiano Ronaldo from Sporting in 2003, the English giants did not think twice about paying a huge transfer fee for another wing wizard from the same club.  Nani’s initial months at United were spent at the home of his new friend, Cristiano Ronaldo, and the winger did not waste time making his mark for the Red Devils. A triumphant first season ended with Premier League and UEFA Champions league winners’ medals.  He has been a fixture in the Portugal side since 2006, playing at UEFA EURO 2008 and EURO 2012, but he has yet to grace the biggest stage of them all. He was selected in Carlos Queiroz’s squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™, but an injury shortly before the tournament forced him out of it.

Handed a starting place in the position filled with some distinction by the equally talented Alan Dzagoev in Poland and Ukraine, the youngster has given fresh impetus to the front line following Andrey Arshavin’s exit from the side. Capello’s faith in him has been rewarded. Tucking in alongside the experienced Alexander Kerzhakov and Alexander Samedov, Kokorin excelled in the qualifiers for Brazil 2014, scoring four times in all – once in each game against Israel and twice in the 4-1 defeat of Luxembourg. One of those goals against the Israelis, which came after some fine work by Samedov, proved how sharp and opportunistic a finisher he can be and the level of understanding he has built up with his team-mates. His fine performances for his country and for Dinamo Moscow – the club where he scored his first goal at the age of 17 – convinced Anzhi Makhachkala to pay a big fee for his services at the start of the 2013 season.

Restricted to a late appearance in Russia’s ill-fated 2002 campaign, Kerzhakov is now a vital cog in a side that is looking to get beyond the group phase for the first time in its history. \\r\\nThe front man proved his worth in the qualifying competition for Brazil 2014, scoring five goals in all, including his side’s winner in a crucial 1-0 defeat of Portugal. Though 31, Kerzhakov has shown himself to be someone upon whom coach Fabio Capello can rely. The striker has had his ups and downs since his last World Cup appearance, missing out on a place in the Russia squad that reached the semi-finals at UEFA EURO 2008. Though back in the frame the following year, he was sent off as Russia went down to defeat against Slovenia in the South Africa 2010 play-offs. \\r\\nAfter leading the Russian attack under Dick Advocaat in 2011 and appearing at EURO 2012 he has consolidated his place in the side under Capello, and now has Vladimir Beschastnykh’s record as the national team’s all-time leading goalscorer in his sights. He achieved another landmark in October 2013, striking his 208th career goal to become Russian football’s most prolific marksman ever. \\r\\nKerzhakov is something of an idol at Zenit St Petersburg, where he has spent ten seasons in two separate spells, winning the 2010 and 2012 league titles after returning there four years ago.

Hard-working, technically gifted and a lethal finisher, Forlan is known first and foremost as a centre-forward, although in recent times he has also enjoyed success in a deeper, more creative role. Forlan played tennis until the age of 14, but there was never really any doubt that he would end up as a footballer. Indeed, his father played in two FIFA World Cups™, in England in 1966 and Germany in 1974, while his maternal grandfather coached Uruguay at Chile 1962. At the age of 18, Forlan made his professional debut for Argentinian side Independiente, for whom he went on to score 40 goals in 91 appearances. That impressive record earned him a move to Manchester United, but, despite winning three trophies, he never quite matched his previous form and eventually joined Villarreal.

He achieved that same double feat again in 2008/09, after finding the net 35 times for Atletico Madrid. Forlan's international career began in 1999 at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Nigeria, where he scored once. He made his senior debut for Uruguay under Victor Pua in early 2002 and played at Korea/Japan 2002, his first FIFA World Cup finals, just a few months later, scoring in his only appearance. Since then, Forlan has been an ever-present for the national team. He scored six times in the preliminaries for Germany 2006, but it was not enough to take Uruguay to the finals. Tabarez then arrived as head coach, but Forlan continued to play a leading role, scoring seven goals to finish as  leading marksman in qualifying for South Africa 2010. The high point of Forlan's career to date came at South Africa 2010, where he picked up the adidas Golden Ball award as the tournament's best player.

        "Edinson CAVANI": "Composed, opportunistic and a lethal finisher, Edinson Cavani has shown since joining Paris Saint-Germain that he has all the attributes of a born goalscorer. His imposing physique makes him a dangerous aerial threat, while his skill and reading of the game allows him to play anywhere in attack and even in midfield, as he has done more than once for Uruguay. , as Cavani is known, made his professional debut at 19 for Danubio. In total he scored 12 times for the club, and won the Uruguayan league title with them in 2006/07. In early 2007 he represented the Uruguay U-20s at the South American Youth Championship, where he scored seven goals to help his side qualify for the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada. Cavani had little time to celebrate that success, and on his 20th birthday he flew to Italy to join Palermo. It took him some time to settle, however, as he managed just two goals for his new club in the second half of the season, and found the net only once at Canada 2007. Oscar Tabarez gave Cavani his full international debut in a friendly against Colombia in early 2008, and the striker duly marked the occasion with a goal. Cavani then featured throughout Uruguay's qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™, but failed to score in any of his seven appearances. His contribution, nonetheless, earned him a starting role in six of Uruguay's seven games at South Africa 2010, and he scored his only goal of the tournament in 's defeat in the match for third place. Cavani scored 15 times in his final two seasons with Palermo, but it was not until he joined Napoli that the goals really started flowing, winning the Serie A scoring title during the 2012/13 season before his multi-million transaction to France As well as becoming a fans' idol by breaking the 30-goal mark (in all competitions) in each of his three seasons to date, he is now also Napoli's all-time leading scorer in European football. Since winning the 2011 Copa America, and more recently representing Uruguay at the Men's Olympic Football Tournament London 2012 as one of their three over-age players and at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil, Cavani has continued to play a pivotal role for Tabarez. He was the only player to have appeared in every one of 's Brazil 2014 qualifiers, scoring five goals during the campaign.  "

        "Clint DEMPSEY": "A striker with an indomitable personality and a will to win unrivaled by any in the game, Clint Dempsey is an icon of USA's national team. According to many, he is the team’s beating heart. He has it all: goal-scoring panache, a creative, play-making sensibility, and a grim desire to chase back when a foray breaks down. Dempsey’s one of only three Americans to score in multiple FIFA World Cups™ and he is hoping to make Brazil 2014 – likely his last world finals – a special moment. \\r\\nHe began his club career in Major League Soccer, earning Rookie of the Year honours with New England Revolution, before heading for Fulham of the English Premier League. He had a hugely successful series of seasons at Craven Cottage, where he became the club’s all-time top-scorer in the Premier League and led them to an unprecedented UEFA Europa League final, though Atletico Madrid came out on top 2-1 to take the crown. His general play and output in front of goal earned him a chance with crosstown London glamour club Tottenham Hotspur, where he was unfortunate not to break into the first-team on a regular basis, necessitating a huge-money return to MLS with Seattle Sounders in 2013. \\r\\nDempsey has been voted three times as US Soccer’s Player of the Year and scored the team’s only goal of an ill-fated Germany 2006 campaign. He can play as an out-and-out striker, dropped in behind the front-men or even out on a wider perch, making him a useful and crucial cog for the Americans. “I play with a lot of heart and every time I go out on the field I do all I can to help get that win,” Dempsey, whose temperament and character are a perfect fit for his national team, told . “We work hard as a team and we need that to not change if we’re going to achieve.” "

        "Aron JOHANNSSON": "Aron Johannsson may be young and new to the USA fold, but coach Jurgen Klinsmann has a great deal of faith in this unknown striker. He packs pace and goal-scoring acumen and possesses the ability to play as an out-and-out No9 or wide on the wing if circumstances should require. \\r\\nJohannson was born in Alabama while his parents were traveling students and returned to Iceland at the age of three. Johannsson showed an early aptitude on the football pitch and he began his club career in Iceland with Fjölnir before moving on to AGF Aarhus in Denmark, where he scored 23 goals in 65 appearances for the club. The youngster’s scorching form led to a move to Dutch football and AZ Alkmaar, where he partnered for a time with now international team-mate Jozy Altidore in attack. \\r\\nDespite offers to play for Iceland’s national team, who reached the European qualifying play-offs for Brazil 2014, Johannsson chose instead to align himself with his birth nation, bringing a smile to the face of Klinsmann and a much-needed goal-scoring threat off the bench for the  ahead of the world finals in Brazil.

        "Jozy ALTIDORE": "Jozy Altidore is an enigmatic striker. His brawny build and physical power make him a nightmare for defenders with his back to goal, and his ability to hold the ball up and bring teammates into the play is as good as any in the world. While questions have been raised about his commitment and output, Altidore seems to have found his proper rhythm under current  coach Jurgen Klinsmann. \\r\\nYoung Altidore made history when he moved to Spain’s La Liga in 2008 to try his luck with Villarreal. But the dream of becoming the first American to star in one of Europe’s top leagues faded as he found himself shipped out on a series of season-long loans. He revived his fortunes with a move to the Netherlands and AZ Alkmaar, where he scored 39 goals in 67 appearances and helped the club to a rare Dutch Cup crown. His prolific form in the Lowlands brought a much-anticipated move to English Premier League side Sunderland at the start of the current campaign, where Altidore has, once again, struggled to find consistent playing time or form.\\r\\nAfter being dropped by Klinsmman for a pair of games early in the Brazil 2014 qualifying cycle, Altidore regained his focus. He ended a long scoring drought and showed the kind of intensity that makes coaches drool and defenders lose sleep. He refined his game over the course of the CONCACAF qualifying , adding positional sense and increased work-rate to his bag of tricks.  While sharpening his own game to a razor's edge, he expects the same from his mates in the US side ahead of his second FIFA World Cup™. “We’re at our best when we’re battling together as a team,” Altidore told . “We need to be a hard team to beat.”  "

        "Chris WONDOLOWSKI": "A scoring sensation in Major League Soccer, the humble and soft-spoken Chris Wondolowski could prove a dangerous threat off the bench for Jurgen Klinsmann’s USA team at the world finals in Brazil. A fan favourite with club side San Jose Earthquakes, Wondolowski – who makes up for his lack of pace with a keen eye for goal and a tireless work-rate – finished top scorer in the US top flight in 2010 and 2012 and was named to the league’s annual best XI on three occasions. He is his club’s all-time top-scorer and a predator with few rivals on the American club scene. \\r\\nHis performances in northern California were enough to earn him a place in the USA side for the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup. He grabbed the brass ring with both hands too, finishing tied for top scorer as the went on to win the continental showpiece. “I’m not the fastest, I’m not the strongest and I’m not the most technical player,” the man they call  told  in between scoring goals for fun at the Gold Cup. “So I need to read the game, read the defenders and try to anticipate what they’re going to do.
